      A plain browserless_agent session (no proxy, no stealth) renders the same

      No public REST/JSON API exists (the site is Laravel + Inertia, not
      WordPress). The same JSON is obtainable by sending an 'X-Inertia: true'
      request header, but the embedded <script id="app"> payload needs no custom
      headers, so fetch is preferred.

# Search Latest Remote Jobs on Remote DXB

## Purpose

Retrieve the most recently posted remote and hybrid jobs from Remote DXB (`remotedxb.com`), a UAE/Dubai-focused remote job board. Returns a structured, newest-first list of listings with title, company, location, work model, commitment, posted date, category, salary range, tags, and the canonical job-detail URL. This is a **read-only** skill — it lists/searches jobs and never applies. The optimal path requires **no live browser**: a single HTTP GET returns the full server-rendered job feed as JSON, because the site is a Laravel + Inertia.js app that embeds its page data in the HTML.

## When to Use

- "Show me the latest / newest remote jobs in Dubai (or the UAE)."
- "What remote jobs were posted today on Remote DXB?"
- "Find completely-remote or hybrid roles in a category (engineering, marketing, sales, …)."
- "Search Remote DXB for jobs matching a keyword / location / tag."
- Building a feed or alert of fresh UAE remote/hybrid openings.

## Workflow

The recommended method is a single **`browserless_agent`** call that navigates the homepage and reads the embedded JSON in-page — the latest jobs are sorted newest-first and embedded directly in the server-rendered HTML. No proxy, no login, no waiting for hydration.

1. **`goto` `https://www.remotedxb.com/` and parse the `#app` script in-page.** Use the `www.` host: the apex `https://remotedxb.com/` 301-redirects to `www` (a real browser follows the redirect natively, but hitting `www` directly saves the hop). Cloudflare fronts the site but serves content normally to a plain `browserless_agent` — no `proxy` arg is needed (verified). One call does the whole job:

   ```json
   {
     "commands": [
       {
         "method": "goto",
         "params": {
           "url": "https://www.remotedxb.com/",
           "waitUntil": "load",
           "timeout": 45000
         }
       },
       {
         "method": "evaluate",
         "params": {
           "content": "(()=>{ const el = document.getElementById('app'); const page = JSON.parse(el.getAttribute('data-page') || el.textContent); const p = page.props; const L = p.listings; return JSON.stringify({ total: L.total, current_page: L.current_page, last_page: L.last_page, per_page: L.per_page, next_page_url: L.next_page_url, jobs: L.data }); })()"
         }
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

   The `evaluate` returns the projected paginator under `.value` — no need to ship the raw HTML. (Same data is also available by sending an `X-Inertia: true` request header from a raw client, but the in-page `#app` read needs no custom headers.)

2. **Read the Inertia payload.** The `#app` element carries the Inertia `data-page` object; `props.listings` is the Laravel paginator (the `evaluate` above already projects it).
3. **Read `props.listings`** — a Laravel paginator:
   `{ current_page, last_page, per_page (10), total, from, to, data[], next_page_url }`.
   `props.listings.data` is already **sorted newest-first by `postedDate`** — that array _is_ the latest jobs.
4. **Map each item** to your output shape (see Expected Output). Useful fields per listing: `id, title, companyName, companyLogo, location, primaryCountryCode, remoteStatus, remoteLabel, commitment, postedDate, category, categorySlug, salaryRange, tags, href, applyMethod, applyLink, applyEmail, excerpt, description` (description is HTML).
5. **For more than 10 results**, fetch `https://www.remotedxb.com/?page=2`, `?page=3`, … (follow `next_page_url`). Each page returns the next 10 in the same newest-first order.
6. **To filter** (all params combine), add query params whose names are the **camelCase plural** facet props with `[]`, using the slugs found in the homepage props (`props.categories`, `props.locations`, `props.remoteStatuses`, `props.tags`, etc.):
   - `?search=<text>` — free-text keyword
   - `?categories[]=engineering-architecture`
   - `?locations[]=dubai`
   - `?remoteStatuses[]=completely-remote` (or `hybrid`)
   - `?tags[]=ai`, `?experiences[]=<slug>`, `?commitments[]=<slug>`, `?salaryRanges[]=<slug>`
   - Echoed back under `props.filters`; unknown param names are silently ignored (full list returned, `filters: []`).

### Snapshot fallback (only if the `#app` JSON read fails)

If the `#app` script is ever absent or its shape drifts, fall back to reading the rendered cards from the same `browserless_agent` call — a plain no-proxy agent is sufficient (no Cloudflare challenge, verified across runs):

1. `{ "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "https://www.remotedxb.com/", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } }`.
2. `{ "method": "snapshot" }` — the 10 newest job cards are server-rendered and present immediately; no scroll or wait is required for the first page.
3. Read each card: title, company, location, work-model badge (Completely Remote / Hybrid), commitment (Full Time / Contract / Part Time), the "Today"/date label, and the `/job/<slug>--<id>` link.
4. For more results, add another `goto` on `?page=2`, etc. Batching a page's `goto` + read in one call is convenient (fewer round-trips); the session also persists across separate calls (keyed by `proxy`/`profile`), so splitting across calls works too.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **It's Laravel + Inertia.js, not WordPress.** Detect via the `Vary: X-Inertia` response header. There is no `/wp-json` API. The "API" is simply the JSON embedded in every page's `<script id="app" type="application/json">` tag (and the same data is returned with an `X-Inertia: true` request header, but the embedded-script approach needs no custom headers).
- **Always use `www.`** — `remotedxb.com` → 301 → `www.remotedxb.com`. A real browser follows the redirect natively, but pointing `goto` straight at `www` saves a round-trip.
- **A `proxy` arg is NOT required** despite the homepage being Cloudflare-fronted (a pre-run probe hinted proxies might be needed, but a plain no-proxy `browserless_agent` returns 200 with full content). Don't set `proxy` unless you actually start seeing a Cloudflare challenge.
- **Newest-first is the default sort** on the homepage feed — no sort param needed for "latest jobs." Page 1 = the freshest listings.
- **Pagination is 10 per page** (`per_page: 10`, ~2,000+ total listings, ~200 pages). Use `?page=N` / `next_page_url`.
- **Filter param names are camelCase plural with `[]`** (`categories[]`, `locations[]`, `remoteStatuses[]`, `tags[]`, …). Bare `categories=` (no brackets) returns **HTTP 500**; `category[]` (singular) and `remote_status[]` (snake_case) are silently ignored and return the unfiltered list.
- **Job detail URL pattern is `/job/<slug>--<numericId>`** with a **double dash** before the id (e.g. `/job/medical-escort-a-r-t-ambulance-services-llc--195239`). It is NOT `/jobs/<id>` — `/jobs/<id>` does not resolve to a listing.
- **`location` may be a UAE emirate** (Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, Umm Al Quwain, …) **or `GLOBAL`** for worldwide-remote roles.
- **`applyEmail` is often `mailto:` (empty)** when `applyMethod` is `link`; the real apply target is then `applyLink` (e.g. `https://www.remotedxb.com/apply/<code>`).
- Homepage props also carry the full facet vocabularies you can use to build filters: `props.categories` (id/name/slug/count), `props.locations`, `props.remoteStatuses`, `props.tags`, `props.experiences`, `props.commitments`, `props.salaryRanges`, `props.languages`.
