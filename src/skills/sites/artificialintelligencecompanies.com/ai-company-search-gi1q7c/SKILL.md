# Find AI Companies by Niche or Problem on artificialintelligencecompanies.com

## Purpose

Given a niche (e.g. "healthcare", "customer service", "legal") or a problem statement (e.g. "automate inbound phone calls", "label training data", "detect insurance fraud"), return matching AI companies and startups from the public directory at `artificialintelligencecompanies.com`. For each match, return the company name, canonical directory URL path, and a short description. Read-only; never mutates the directory.

> The site is explicitly agent-friendly: `robots.txt` allows `GPTBot`, `ClaudeBot`, `ChatGPT-User`, `PerplexityBot`; `/llms.txt` advertises the API; and `/.well-known/agent-manifest.json` enumerates capabilities. No API key is needed for read access.

> **Prompt assumption (placeholder template):** the source prompt referenced `{niche}` and `{problem}` as unfilled placeholders. This skill treats them as **two synonymous facets of the same input** — the caller supplies one free-text string that is either an industry/vertical niche or a problem-to-solve phrase. The skill routes the same query through the same endpoint either way; the directory's `/api/search/` does keyword matching across both category names and company descriptions.

## When to Use

- Mapping a vertical (healthcare AI, legal AI, computer vision, AI receptionists, training-data services) to a shortlist of vendors.
- Translating an unstructured pain point ("our reps are drowning in tickets" → AI customer service vendors; "we need someone to phone-screen leads" → AI receptionist vendors) into a candidate vendor list.
- Building a market-map / competitive-landscape dataset across one of the 12 directory categories.
- Anywhere you'd otherwise scrape an AI vendor list by hand — the JSON API is faster and cheaper than rendering the site, and `/cat/<slug>/` pages have richer JSON-LD than the API returns.

## Workflow

The site exposes a documented read-only REST API plus an MCP server, both linked from `/llms.txt`. **Lead with the JSON API for keyword queries**, and supplement with the `/cat/<slug>/` HTML pages when you need full (non-truncated) descriptions or a complete category roster. A browser is only needed for the HTML category pages — and even those are just a `browserless_agent` `goto` + an `evaluate` that parses the embedded JSON-LD (no `proxy` arg needed); no JavaScript renders the company list (it's server-rendered with JSON-LD embedded).

1. **Pick the input shape.** Keyword search (one query string covering the niche or problem) is the common case. If the caller already knows the directory's taxonomy slug (e.g. `healthcare-ai`), prefer the category page directly — it returns more data.

2. **Keyword search (primary path)** — when input is a niche/problem string:

   ```
   GET https://artificialintelligencecompanies.com/api/search/?q={query}
   ```
   - `q` is required, URL-encode multi-word queries (`q=customer%20service`).
   - Returns `{"companies": [{name, url, description}, ...], "categories": [{name, url, description}, ...]}`.
   - **Hard-capped at 5 companies + matching categories** regardless of how popular the term is. A `limit` query param is silently accepted but ignored — see Gotchas.
   - Descriptions are **truncated to ~100 chars with a `...` suffix**. Use step 4 to fetch the full text.
   - Returns HTTP 200 with empty arrays (`{"companies": [], "categories": []}`) for no-hit queries; also returns 200 with empty arrays for 1-character `q` despite the OpenAPI declaring `minLength: 2` — treat empty-arrays as no-match.
   - Any matching `categories[*].url` (path like `/cat/healthcare-ai/`) is your hook into step 3 for the full vertical roster.

3. **Category-roster search (best for full coverage of a vertical)** — when input is a vertical/niche and you want the entire roster of vendors in that category:

   ```
   GET https://artificialintelligencecompanies.com/cat/{slug}/
   ```
   - Parse `<script type="application/ld+json">` blocks; there are 3 per page. The third is `@type: ItemList` with each item as an `Organization` containing `name`, `url`, and a **full untruncated description**. The first is a `CollectionPage` with `numberOfItems` (use as a count of expected rows).
   - Use this whenever the search API truncates a description you need, or when 5 results aren't enough.
   - **Stable 12-category enum** (as of 2026-05-19, verified via `/api/categories/?format=json`):
     `ai-automation-agencies`, `ai-consulting`, `ai-customer-service`, `ai-image-generators`, `ai-platforms`, `ai-receptionist`, `computer-vision`, `foundation-model-providers`, `healthcare-ai`, `legal-ai`, `machine-learning-platforms`, `training-data`.
   - To map a free-text vertical to a slug without keyword-searching first, hit `GET /api/categories/?format=json` (returns `{success, total, categories: [{id, slug, name, description}, ...]}`).

4. **Hydrate full descriptions** — when a search-API hit gave you a truncated description and the company belongs to a category, the company will also appear in that category page's JSON-LD `ItemList` with the full text. Cross-reference by `name`. (Direct individual-company JSON is **not available** — see Gotchas: `/api/companies/{id}/` is 500, and `/co/<slug>/` HTML is 500.)

5. **Combine and dedupe.** If your input is both a niche and a problem (e.g. "AI receptionist for plumbing companies"), run both phrasings through `/api/search/?q=` and union by `name`. Then for each company whose category you can identify (via the `categories[]` array in the same response), pull the full description from the corresponding `/cat/<slug>/` JSON-LD.

### Alternative: MCP server

`/llms.txt` advertises `http://artificialintelligencecompanies.com/mcp-server/` as a downloadable MCP server. If you have an MCP-aware host (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.) and are doing repeated discovery queries, install it. Not exercised in this skill's iteration — `recommended_method` stays `api` because the raw HTTPS calls are zero-setup and equally effective for one-shot lookups.

### Browser fallback

Only useful when the JSON API is fully blocked (no evidence this has ever happened — no auth, no anti-bot, served via Cloudflare with permissive `robots.txt`):

1. `browserless_agent` with a `goto` to `https://artificialintelligencecompanies.com/search/?q={query}` — the HTML search results page. Server-rendered, no JS required. Note: this page does **not** carry JSON-LD; you'd be parsing rendered HTML, which is strictly worse than the API.
2. `browserless_agent` with a `goto` to `https://artificialintelligencecompanies.com/cat/{slug}/` — the category page. Server-rendered with rich JSON-LD as described in step 3.

A single `goto` + an in-page `evaluate` (or a `text`/`html` read) is sufficient for both pages, with **no** `proxy` arg — this site needs no stealth or residential proxy on any path.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **`/api/companies/` is broken site-wide**: the OpenAPI-documented `GET /api/companies/?search=&category=&country=&status=` returns **HTTP 500** for every parameter combination tested on 2026-05-19 (no params, `?search=healthcare`, `?category=healthcare-ai`, `?limit=3`, with and without `format=json`). The browsable HTML form at the same path also renders the Django "Add Category Api" form rather than a list. **Do not waste turns on this endpoint** — use `/api/search/?q=` for keyword search and `/cat/<slug>/` JSON-LD for category rosters.
- **`/api/companies/{id}/` (detail by id) is broken**: returns HTTP 500 for `id=1` (and presumably all ids). The OpenAPI spec advertises it; the implementation is unavailable as of 2026-05-19.
- **Every `/co/<slug>/` company detail HTML page returns 500**: verified across `openai`, `anthropic`, `abridge`, `databricks`, `zendesk`, `goodcall` — 5 different company slugs spanning the alphabet. The site lists 208+ companies in its hero, but none of the canonical company-profile URLs render. **The only place to read a full company description today is the `/cat/<slug>/` page's JSON-LD `ItemList`** (step 3) or the truncated search response.
- **`/api/search/` is hard-capped at 5 company results**: `?limit=N` is silently accepted but ignored — no matter what value you pass, you get at most 5 `companies[]` entries plus matching categories. Treat the search endpoint as a "top hits" lookup, not a paginated list. For broad coverage, walk the relevant category pages instead.
- **`/api/search/` descriptions are truncated to ~100 chars with `...` suffix**: full untruncated descriptions only live in the JSON-LD on `/cat/<slug>/` pages. Cross-reference by `name`.
- **`/api/categories/` requires `?format=json`**: without it the endpoint serves the Django REST framework browsable HTML form ("Add Category Api"), not JSON. The OpenAPI spec doesn't mention this. Always append `&format=json` (or send `Accept: application/json` if you control headers). The `/api/search/` endpoint does **not** need `format=json` — it defaults to JSON.
- **`minLength: 2` on the search `q` param is not enforced**: `?q=x` returns HTTP 200 with empty arrays rather than HTTP 400. Don't rely on the spec — validate input on your side if length matters.
- **`url` fields in API responses are relative paths**, not absolute URLs (e.g. `"url": "/co/anthropic/"`, `"url": "/cat/healthcare-ai/"`). Prefix with `https://artificialintelligencecompanies.com` before display. Also note the canonical URLs in `/llms.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, and JSON-LD use `http://` (not `https://`) — the site redirects `http://` → `https://` cleanly, but normalize on `https://` for cross-system consistency.
- **`/cat/<slug>/` pages have 3 JSON-LD blocks**: `CollectionPage` (metadata + `numberOfItems`), `BreadcrumbList` (navigation), and `ItemList` (the actual roster). Parse the third one — match on `"@type": "ItemList"`, not on position, since order is not contractual.
- **Stable 12-category taxonomy** as of 2026-05-19 (`/api/categories/?format=json` `total: 12`). New categories may be added — re-enumerate before assuming the list is current.
- **No auth, no anti-bot, no stealth required**: Cloudflare-fronted, served from edge cache. A `proxy` arg on `browserless_agent` is unnecessary. The site explicitly opts in to AI crawler traffic (see `robots.txt`).
- **MCP server URL advertised but not exercised here**: `/mcp-server/` is listed in `/llms.txt` and `/.well-known/agent-manifest.json` but was not validated as part of this skill's iteration. If you are an MCP-aware client, fetching `/mcp-server/` should give you tool definitions equivalent to the three working HTTP endpoints.
