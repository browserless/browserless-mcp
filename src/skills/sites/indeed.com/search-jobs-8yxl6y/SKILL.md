# Indeed Job Search

## Purpose

Given a search input — full Indeed search URL, free-form `keyword + location`, keyword only, location only, or a direct `/viewjob?jk=<jk>` URL — return structured JSON job results matching the **full Indeed filter surface** (keyword, location, radius, date posted, salary, job type, experience level, remote/hybrid, company, education, "posted by", "encouraged to apply", sort order, pagination). For each posting return Indeed `jk`, title, company + rating + review count, location with `remote`/`hybrid` flags, salary (formatted + raw min/max/currency/period/source), posted date (relative + ISO), job type, snippet, qualifications, benefits, urgent-hiring / easily-apply / sponsored flags, company logo URL, canonical `viewjob` URL, and the company profile URL when linked. Capture total result count and pagination metadata so the caller knows the slice is partial. **Read-only — never click Apply, Save Job, Sign In, Easy Apply, or submit any form.**

## When to Use

- "Find software engineering jobs in Austin posted in the last 3 days under $200k full-time" — multi-filter SERP extraction.
- Daily / hourly monitoring of new postings for a saved query (`fromage=1` + `sort=date`).
- Mapping a free-form query (`"barista, 30307"`) into Indeed's `q` / `l` / `radius` URL.
- Single-posting fetch when only a `jk` or `/viewjob?jk=…` URL is in hand — skips the SERP entirely.
- Comparing remote vs on-site availability for a role across metros.
- Anywhere the legacy Indeed Publisher API was used — that path was deprecated for new accounts in 2023 (`/ita/v1/publisher` returns 404 today, confirmed via residential-proxy fetch on 2026-05-18).

## Workflow

Indeed is anti-bot-walled (Cloudflare + Akamai-style fingerprinting + a bot-detection redirect to `account/login?from=bot-detection-anonymous`). The public Publisher API (`/ita/v1/publisher`) was deprecated. The internal GraphQL endpoint (`https://apis.indeed.com/graphql`) is `Disallow`'d in `robots.txt` for all user agents and is firewalled at the gateway — its OneGraph key is even leaked in the page HTML (`oneGraphApiKey: "eac18cd3a45d…"`) and still won't authorize anonymous traffic. The only viable path is scripted browsing through a `browserless_agent` call with a **residential proxy** (anti-bot stealth is on by default), treating `window._initialData` (and `window.mosaic.providerData["MosaicProviderRichSearchDaemon"]`) as the structured-data surface.

> **Batch each URL's flow into one call.** A `browserless_agent` session persists across calls, keyed by the `proxy`/`profile` config — repeat the same config to reconnect to it. Still batch the whole flow for a given URL — open → wait → extract — inside ONE call's `commands` array, so you don't round-trip or accidentally drop the config between steps. Pass `proxy: { proxy: "residential" }` on **every** call (dropping it lands you on a datacenter IP → instant 403; the session is keyed on it, so a call without it is a different, blocked session). Stealth is default; only if a Cloudflare/Turnstile challenge actually renders do you need the `solve` command (`solve { type: "cloudflare" }`).

### 1. Parse input → canonical URL

Branch on input shape:

| Input shape                                  | Action                                                                                                            |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `https://www.indeed.com/jobs?...` URL        | Use as-is. Add missing filter params from the request (see § 2).                                                  |
| `https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=<jk>` URL | Skip search — go straight to § 5 (viewjob extraction).                                                            |
| Free-form `"<keyword> in <location>"`        | Split on `" in "` / `","`; URL-encode → `?q=<kw>&l=<loc>`.                                                        |
| Keyword only                                 | `?q=<kw>` (Indeed defaults to nationwide).                                                                        |
| Location only                                | `?l=<loc>` (returns all postings in that location).                                                               |
| ZIP-only location (`"30307"`)                | `?l=<zip>` — Indeed parses the ZIP. (Invalid ZIPs like `99999` parse to `parsedL: null` and return zero results.) |

The keyword field accepts boolean operators (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`), quoted phrases, and field prefixes (`title:`, `company:`, `location:`) — pass through verbatim, URL-encode the whole thing.

### 2. Filter → URL parameter mapping

All filter dimensions in the request must be encoded as query-string params on `/jobs?…`. **Use this table verbatim — every ID below was verified against the embedded `filterSettingModel` and `radiusOptions` in `MosaicProviderRichSearchDaemon` on 2026-05-18.**

| Filter                               | Param                                                                                                                                                                                          | Accepted values                                                                                                                                                                                             |

`sc=` is a **composite-filter slot**. Multiple facets concatenate with `;`-delimited tokens inside one `sc=0kf:` block, all URL-encoded together. Example: Remote + full-time + entry level + Indeed Apply →

```
sc=0kf%3Aattr%28DSQF7%29attr%28CF3CP%29explvl%28entry_level%29%3B&jt=fulltime&iafilter=1
```

When in doubt: build the URL by clicking the equivalent filters in the rendered SERP and copying the URL from the location bar — the page rewrites `sc=` in place.

### 3. Residential proxy is mandatory

Every `browserless_agent` call must carry `proxy: { proxy: "residential" }` (optionally `proxyCountry: "us"`). A bare datacenter-IP hit of `/jobs?q=…&l=…` returns a 403 "Security Check — Indeed.com" interstitial (59,756 bytes of styled-but-empty HTML — no `window._initialData`, no `jk` markers, no filter rail). A residential-proxy session returns the real SERP, but only ~80% of the time — see § Site-Specific Gotchas for the intermittent 401 pattern. Stealth is on by default and clears the Cloudflare/Akamai fingerprint gate without extra flags.

### 4. Open the search URL and extract `window._initialData`

Run these as one `browserless_agent` call (`proxy: { proxy: "residential" }`), with the whole open → wait → extract sequence in one `commands` array:

```json
[
  {
    "method": "goto",
    "params": { "url": "<SEARCH_URL>", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 }
  },
  { "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 2500 } },
  {
    "method": "evaluate",
    "params": {
      "content": "(()=>{ /* parse window._initialData in-page, return JSON.stringify of the projected job list — see below */ })()"
    }
  }
]
```

Never use `networkidle0`/`networkidle2` (they hang on Indeed's SPA). **Parse `window._initialData` in-page inside the `evaluate` and return only a compact projection** (the projected job objects + SERP metadata) — the raw SERP HTML is 600 KB–1 MB, so shipping it back is wasteful and exceeds result-size limits; extract in-page and return the small JSON instead. The `evaluate` result comes back under `.value`.

`window._initialData` is a JS-assigned object literal that begins with `window._initialData = {` and ends with `};` — inside the `evaluate` you can read `window._initialData` directly (it is a live global), or scan balanced braces (string-aware) from the open brace if you are working from raw HTML, decode `/` → `/`, then `JSON.parse`. The data-bearing keys for a SERP:

Per-card data lives inside `mosaicData` and in the rendered DOM as `data-jk="<jk>"` anchor attributes — read both to be robust. For each card, derive the canonical URL as `https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=<jk>`.

If the page is missing `window._initialData` entirely, check the response (the `evaluate` can return the `document.title` alongside the projection):

- Title `<title>Security Check - Indeed.com</title>` → 403 anti-bot. The session persists across calls keyed by the `proxy` config, so re-running the identical call reconnects to the same blocked session — vary the session config to draw a fresh residential exit IP; if it keeps rendering, a Cloudflare/Turnstile challenge may be live — add a `solve { type: "cloudflare" }` command before the extract.
- Title `<title>Authenticating...</title>` → 401 bot-detection-anonymous. Re-run up to 3× with a varied session config to rotate the residential exit IP (repeating the identical `proxy` reconnects to the same session, so change it to force a new one), then give up and emit `bot_block`.

### 5. (Per posting) Hydrate each `jk` from `/viewjob?jk=<jk>`

Card-level data on the SERP is **incomplete** — salary range, benefits chips, full snippet, qualifications, company rating, and the original-source apply URL all live on the viewjob detail page. For each `jk` from § 4 that the caller wants enriched, run one `browserless_agent` call (`proxy: { proxy: "residential" }`) per `jk` with open → wait → extract in one `commands` array:

```json
[
  {
    "method": "goto",
    "params": {
      "url": "https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=<JK>",
      "waitUntil": "load",
      "timeout": 45000
    }
  },
  { "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 1500 } },
  {
    "method": "evaluate",
    "params": {
      "content": "(()=>{ /* read window._initialData + ld+json in-page, return JSON.stringify of the projected job object */ })()"
    }
  }
]
```

Again, parse `window._initialData` and the `<script type="application/ld+json">` block **in-page** inside the `evaluate` and return only the projected job object — a viewjob page is 600–700 KB, so don't ship the raw HTML back.

`/viewjob?jk=` is explicitly **allowed for Googlebot, Bingbot, ChatGPT-User, Claude-User, Perplexity-User, Claude-SearchBot** in `robots.txt` (and `Disallow`'d for the bare `User-agent: *`) — meaning Indeed serves these pages with less friction than `/jobs?`. Empirically the residential-proxy success rate on `/viewjob?` is much higher than on `/jobs?` (0/4 failures in iter-1 vs ~1/5 on SERP).

From the viewjob HTML extract three sources in this order — **prefer the deepest source for each field**:

1. **`window._initialData.hostQueryExecutionResult.data.jobData.results[0].job`** — the GraphQL response that Indeed embeds for SSR. Contains `key`, `title`, `sourceEmployerName`, `datePublished` (epoch ms), `dateOnIndeed` (epoch ms), `expired`, `description.html`, `feed.feedSourceType` (`EMPLOYER` / `JOBSITE` / `STAFFING`), `tracking.jobClick.url` (the `/rc/clk?…` sponsored-redirect URL), and `url` (the external apply URL, e.g. an ATS like Greenhouse/Lever/Breezy).
2. **`window._initialData.jobInfoWrapperModel.jobInfoModel.jobInfoHeaderModel`** — the company-tab data: `companyName`, `companyOverviewLink` (Indeed profile), `companyReviewLink`, `companyReviewModel.ratingsModel.{rating,count}` (e.g. `4.4` / `43`), `companyImagesModel.logoUrl` (`https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/256x256/<hash>`), `companyImagesModel.headerImageUrl`, `formattedLocation`, `remoteLocation` (boolean), `salaryMin` / `salaryMax` / `salaryType` / `salaryCurrency`.
3. **The `<script type="application/ld+json">` block** — schema.org `JobPosting` with `datePosted` ISO string, `description`, `hiringOrganization`, `jobLocation`, and `baseSalary` when present. Use this as the **canonical posted-date source** (ISO 8601 with millisecond precision).

Other top-level `_initialData` fields worth extracting:

- `jobOccupations` — array of taxonomy SUIDs (e.g. `["5NN53","EHPW9","HJSX6"]`) Indeed has classified the role under.
- `benefitsModel.benefits[]` — `[{key:"EY33Q",label:"Health insurance"}, …]` — the benefits chips, with stable per-benefit SUIDs.
- `hiringInsightsModel.age` — human relative time ("30+ days ago", "Posted today").
- `hiringInsightsModel.urgentlyHiringModel` — non-null when "Urgently hiring" badge is rendered.
- `commuteInfoModel` — `jobLatitude`, `jobLongitude`, `formattedStreetAddress`, `companyLocation`.
- `indeedApplyButtonContainer.indeedApplyButtonAttributes` — presence of `jk` + `continueUrl` indicates "Easily Apply" is supported; absence means the apply flow is off-site.
- `sponsored` — top-level boolean.

### 6. Map to output schema and emit

url                     ← "https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=" + jk
```

### 7. No session-release step

There is nothing to release; the session is not torn down on return — it persists across calls, keyed by the `proxy`/`profile` config. Batch the open → wait → extract steps for one URL inside a single call's `commands` array to save round-trips and avoid accidentally dropping the config (a call that drops or changes it lands in a different, blank session with none of the prior cookies). Enrich N viewjob `jk`s with N calls, each self-contained.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **Residential proxy is mandatory (stealth is default).** Any datacenter-IP session gets `<title>Security Check - Indeed.com</title>` (HTTP 403) within the first turn. Verified by a raw datacenter fetch of `/jobs?q=software+engineer&l=Austin,+TX` — 403 every time (page-bare.html, 59,756 bytes, no `window._initialData`). Pass `proxy: { proxy: "residential" }` on every `browserless_agent` call.
- **Even with residential proxies, ~1 in 5 requests on `/jobs?` returns a 401 "Authenticating…" redirect to `/account/login?branding=login-required&from=bot-detection-anonymous&continue=…`.** Confirmed in iter-1 with 6 sequential identical-URL fetches (attempt 2 of 3 came back with HTTP 401, others 200). The 401 body is a 1,656-byte page that does a `HEAD` + reads `cf-ray` then `window.location.replace`s. **Never follow the login redirect** — that path leads to a real signin wall. Recovery: re-run up to 3× with a varied session config to rotate the residential exit IP (repeating the identical `proxy` reconnects to the same session, so change it to force a new one); after 3 consecutive 401s, give up and emit `bot_block`.
- **`/m/jobs?` (mobile search) is harder-blocked than `/jobs?`.** Every attempt on `/m/jobs?q=barista&l=30307` in iter-1 came back 403 "Security Check," even through a residential proxy. Stick to the desktop `/jobs?` URL family.
- **`/viewjob?jk=…` is the friendliest path.** Indeed's `robots.txt` explicitly `Allow`s `/viewjob?` and `/m/viewjob?` for Googlebot, Bingbot, ChatGPT-User, Claude-User, Perplexity-User, and Claude-SearchBot (and `Disallow`s for the wildcard `User-agent: *`). Empirically the residential-proxy success rate is much higher here than on `/jobs?`. If you only need single-posting data, **always prefer `/viewjob?jk=`** over re-running a SERP query.
- **GraphQL is a trap.** `Disallow: /graphql` is in `robots.txt`, and direct POSTs to `https://apis.indeed.com/graphql` are firewalled at the gateway. The OneGraph API key (`eac18cd3a45d091ee9e8bd4b3b181c30303c641d383cb69f86dfdab1876f9047`) is leaked in the page HTML at `_initialData.oneGraphApiKey` but doesn't authorize anonymous traffic. Don't waste time here — the SSR-embedded `_initialData.hostQueryExecutionResult` already contains the GraphQL response.
- **Publisher API is dead.** `/ita/v1/publisher` returns 404. Indeed deprecated the Publisher API for new accounts in 2023 and shut it off for legacy accounts thereafter. Don't reference it.
- **`window._initialData` is the SSR jackpot.** Both `/jobs?` (SERP) and `/viewjob?jk=` (detail) ship a JS-assigned `window._initialData = {…};` block with all server-rendered state. Parse by scanning balanced braces from the assignment site, decode `/` → `/`, `JSON.parse`. The schema differs between SERP and viewjob — see § Workflow steps 4 and 5.
- **`window.mosaic.providerData["MosaicProviderRichSearchDaemon"].filterSettingModel`** is the authoritative source for valid filter enum values (job types, date-posted IDs, radius options). The list of `jt` IDs Indeed accepts today includes **`permanent` and `new_grad`** in addition to the canonical six — silently dropping them costs the caller half the legitimate result set.
- **`l=99999` (or any unparseable location) returns `parsedL: null` + `totalJobCount: 0` + `noSearchResultModel.headerMsg = "The search <b>… jobs in 99999</b> did not match any jobs."`** Validate by checking `parsedL` after extraction — if `null` and the caller passed a non-empty `l`, surface this as `location_unparseable`, not as legitimate zero-result.
- **`fromage="last"` is real but undocumented.** The embedded `filterSettingModel.ages` array includes `{id:"last",label:"New jobs"}` — "since your last visit." Treat it as a synonym for `fromage=1` when no cookie state is in play; pass through verbatim if the caller explicitly asks for "new since last visit."
- **`radius`, `start`, `iafilter`, `alid`, `calert`, `mna`, `sid`, `sp=0` are all `Disallow`'d in `robots.txt`.** They still render correctly through residential-proxy fetch, but Indeed is signalling that these URL patterns are personalized/paginated and should not be indexed. Pass them through; do not strip them from URLs the caller hands you.
- **Indeed serves a 581 KB page even for `/jobs` with no params.** A SERP with results is consistently **620 KB to >1 MB**. Don't ship the raw page back: **parse `window._initialData` in-page inside the `evaluate` and return a compact projection** (the job objects + SERP metadata). This both avoids blowing the result-size cap and keeps the response small — a raw >1 MB HTML body would be truncated or rejected. A raw/datacenter HTTP fetch of the same URL is also useless here (it returns the 403 interstitial, not the SSR data).
- **The 0-pad ZIP heuristic doesn't apply.** Indeed parses `30307` as ATL just fine, but `99999` is treated as a non-existent ZIP — not "Alaska's largest ZIP range start." Pass ZIPs verbatim and trust `parsedL`.
- **Sponsored cards have `_initialData.sponsored: true` and a `tracking.jobClick.url` pointing to `/rc/clk?…` instead of the canonical viewjob URL.** Surface the `sponsored` flag but always emit the canonical `https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=<jk>` as `url`, not the `/rc/clk?` redirect.
- **Read-only stop points (non-negotiable).** Do not click `button: Apply now`, `button: Save Job`, `button: Sign in`, the Indeed Apply iframe, or any pagination button — the pagination state is encoded in the `start=` URL param, navigate by URL. Do not submit the location box (it triggers a typeahead+navigate that can override your filters). Do not click the "Filter" hamburger if the URL already encodes the filter set.
- **Five outcome shapes the caller must handle:** (a) results page, (b) zero results (`totalJobCount: 0` + `noSearchResultModel`), (c) location unparseable (`parsedL: null`), (d) anti-bot 403 / 401 (after retries exhausted — emit `bot_block`), (e) `/viewjob?jk=` 404 when the `jk` has expired (Indeed's 404 page is 64 KB of branded chrome — detect via `<title>Not Found | Indeed</title>`).
- **Field-derivation honesty.** The mapping in § Workflow step 6 covers the fields that were directly observed in a real `viewjob` payload during iter-1 (jk=`5f3a9664e5d61d1a`). Fields the caller asked for that were **not** present on that posting — `qualifications[]`, employer-vs-Indeed-estimated `salary.source`, "hiring multiple candidates" flag — are derived from documented Indeed UI components and the schema.org `JobPosting` shape; surface them when present in the page state, emit `null` otherwise. Do not fabricate values to fill the schema.
