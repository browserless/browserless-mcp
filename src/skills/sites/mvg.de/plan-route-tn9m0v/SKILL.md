# MVG Route Planning (Munich)

## Purpose

Given two stops/locations in the Munich (MVV) public-transport network, return one or more route options with full leg-by-leg details — lines, departure/arrival times, real-time delays, intermediate stops, walking transfers, ticketing zones, and active service disruptions. Read-only — never books a ticket and never opens the customer portal.

The MVV network covers Munich + Greater Munich (S-Bahn, U-Bahn, Tram, Bus, MVV regional bus, and "Bahn" regional rail). Stops in neighboring transit authorities (Ingolstadt, Nürnberg, Landshut, Wolfratshausen, etc.) are also resolvable through the same `globalId` namespace, but their fare zones return empty (`ticketingInformation.zones: []`) because they fall outside the MVV tariff.

## When to Use

- "How do I get from {A} to {B} in Munich [right now | at HH:MM | to arrive by HH:MM]?"
- Daily commute checks: "next train from {home stop} to {work stop}" with real-time delay info.
- Comparing options filtered by mode (e.g. U-Bahn only, no buses, walking only).
- Extracting structured route data (lines, transfer stops, polylines) for downstream display or trip-planning UIs.
- **NOT** for ticket purchasing — use the MVGO app / kundenportal flow instead. This skill stops at the route-suggestions stage.

## Workflow

MVG's public website is a thin client over a JSON REST API at `https://www.mvg.de/api/bgw-pt/v3`. **No auth, no cookies, no anti-bot stealth, no residential proxy** — verified clean 200s direct from a bare sandbox IP. Lead with the API; the browser path works (and is faster than typical because the deep-link URL params auto-submit), but pays a ~50× cost premium and gets you a JS-rendered DOM you have to scrape.

**Transport note (Browserless):** The `bgw-pt/v3` endpoints are a plain HTTPS JSON API — the `GET` examples below are canonical from any client. Under restricted egress, route via `browserless_function` (browser page context: `page.goto('https://www.mvg.de/')` FIRST, then `page.evaluate` a same-origin `fetch` of the `/api/bgw-pt/v3/locations?…` or `/routes?…` path — a bare `fetch` has no egress until the page navigates; return `r.json()`). No proxy/stealth needed (verified clean).

### 1. Resolve each stop name to a `globalId`

`GET https://www.mvg.de/api/bgw-pt/v3/locations?query={text}` — `text` is a partial stop name or street address. Returns an array of up to 50 location matches, ordered by relevance + proximity. Each match has:

```json
{
  "latitude": 48.137245,
  "longitude": 11.575421,
  "place": "München",
  "name": "Marienplatz",
  "globalId": "de:09162:2",
  "divaId": 2,
  "transportTypes": ["SBAHN", "UBAHN", "BUS"],
  "tariffZones": "m",
  "type": "STATION"
}
```

Pick the right match by `place` (city) + `transportTypes` (mode you care about). Munich proper is `place: "München"`. **Be careful with `Hauptbahnhof`** — Munich alone has four distinct stops with that name (`de:09162:6` for the U-Bahn/Tram hub, `de:09162:100` for the main S-Bahn/regional-rail "München Hbf", `de:09162:7000` Hauptbahnhof Nord, `de:09162:5000` Hauptbahnhof Süd) — each lives on a different platform and routing between them requires walking. Disambiguate by transport mode or by asking the user which entrance.

Empty query → `400 getLocations.query: must not be blank`. Nonsense query (e.g. `xyzqwerasdf`) → `200 []`. Always check the array length before indexing.

### 2. Request routes

`GET https://www.mvg.de/api/bgw-pt/v3/routes?originStationGlobalId={A}&destinationStationGlobalId={B}` — minimum required params. Returns an array of route options (typically 5–7) covering the next ~30 minutes of departures.

**Optional params** (verified accepted):

| Param                                                                                 | Value                                                      | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `routingDateTime`                                                                     | ISO 8601 UTC with `.000Z`, e.g. `2026-05-21T08:00:00.000Z` | Anchor search to a specific time. **Must be UTC with explicit `Z` suffix** — `2026-05-21T08:00:00` without `Z` returns 400; `+02:00` offset also returns 400. The server applies Munich TZ (`Europe/Berlin`, UTC+1/+2) internally — `08:00Z` in summer → `10:00` Munich local. |
| `routingDateTimeIsArrival`                                                            | `true` / `false` (default false)                           | When `true`, treat `routingDateTime` as the desired arrival time; the planner works backwards.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `transportTypes`                                                                      | CSV of `UBAHN,SBAHN,TRAM,BUS,BAHN,PEDESTRIAN`              | Restrict to a mode subset. `transportTypes=PEDESTRIAN` returns a single walking-only route.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `offsetInMinutes`                                                                     | integer                                                    | Search starting now + N minutes (alternative to `routingDateTime`).                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `originLatitude` + `originLongitude` + `destinationLatitude` + `destinationLongitude` | floats                                                     | Lat/lon fallback when one or both endpoints are addresses rather than stops. Result will include a leading/trailing `PEDESTRIAN` part to/from the nearest stop.                                                                                                                |

Unknown / mistyped params are silently dropped (the API does not echo back validation errors for typos).

### 3. Decode the response

Top-level is an array; each element is one route option with:

```json
{
  "uniqueId": -1166858465652141928,
  "parts": [ /* one entry per leg — see below */ ],
  "ticketingInformation": { "zones": [0], "alternativeZones": [], "unifiedTicketIds": ["9999","KURZE",...] },
  "distance": 1179.55,
  "bannerHash": "",
  "refreshId": "H4sIAAAA…"     // opaque token used by the website for live refresh
}
```

Each `parts[i]` is one leg of the journey:

```json
{
  "from": {
    "name": "Marienplatz",
    "place": "München",
    "stationGlobalId": "de:09162:2",
    "stationDivaId": 2,
    "latitude": 48.137312,
    "longitude": 11.57534,
    "platform": 2,
    "platformChanged": false,
    "plannedDeparture": "2026-05-20T20:40:00+02:00",
    "departureDelayInMinutes": 3,
    "transportTypes": ["UBAHN", "BUS", "SBAHN"],
    "occupancy": "UNKNOWN",
    "hasZoomData": true, // escalator/elevator live data is published
    "hasOutOfOrderEscalator": true, // accessibility flag
    "hasOutOfOrderElevator": false
  },
  "to": {/* same shape; uses `arrivalDelayInMinutes` instead of departure */},
  "intermediateStops": [/* same shape as from/to per intermediate stop */],
  "line": {
    "label": "S8",
    "transportType": "SBAHN",
    "destination": "Herrsching",
    "trainType": "",
    "network": "ddb",
    "divaId": "92M08",
    "sev": false
  },
  "noChangeRequired": false,
  "pathPolyline": "eyxdHitseAw@bGi@...", // encoded Google polyline of the leg
  "interchangePathPolyline": "", // walk path between platforms when changing trains
  "pathDescription": [],
  "exitLetter": "", // station exit letter (e.g. "B"), when known
  "distance": 1179.55,
  "occupancy": "UNKNOWN",
  "messages": [],
  "infos": [
    {
      "message": "Technischer Defekt am Bahnhof",
      "type": "INCIDENT",
      "network": "ddb"
    }
  ],
  "realTime": true // true ⇒ the times include live data; false ⇒ schedule only
}
```

- **Lines**: `line.label` is the public line designation — `S1`–`S8` for S-Bahn, `U1`–`U8` for U-Bahn, integer (e.g. `53`) for buses, `12`/`17`/`19`/etc. for trams. `line.transportType` is one of `UBAHN | SBAHN | TRAM | BUS | BAHN | PEDESTRIAN`. Walking legs have `line.label: "Fussweg"`, `transportType: "PEDESTRIAN"`, `network: "unknown"`.
- **Delays**: `from.departureDelayInMinutes` and `to.arrivalDelayInMinutes` are absent when zero or when no real-time data is available; check `realTime: true` on the part before trusting them. The website renders these as `+3 Minuten Verspätung`.
- **Disruption messages**: `infos[]` carries `INCIDENT` / `MESSAGE` / `STRIKE` etc.; surface these prominently.
- **Total trip duration**: not a top-level field — compute from `parts[0].from.plannedDeparture` to `parts[-1].to.plannedDeparture` (yes, the last part's `to` uses `plannedDeparture` as its arrival timestamp; there is no separate `plannedArrival` field).
- **Ticketing**: `ticketingInformation.zones` is the MVV fare-zone set ("m" = inner Munich = zone `0`; outer zones are integers `1..6`). Empty `zones: []` means the trip crosses out of MVV (e.g. into VGN around Nürnberg) and the fare is not auto-computable.
- **Polylines**: `pathPolyline` uses the standard Google encoded polyline format; decode with `polyline` libraries when rendering on a map.

### 4. Format and return

Emit one of the shapes in **Expected Output**. Always include real-time delay context and any `infos[]` messages so the caller can decide whether to surface a service warning.

### Browser fallback

If the JSON API is unreachable (rate-limited or under maintenance — neither observed in iter-1 testing), navigate the deep-link URL directly:

```
https://www.mvg.de/verbindungen.html?from={URL-encoded stop name}&to={URL-encoded stop name}&lang=en
```

Drive it with `browserless_agent`: `goto` the deep-link URL with `waitUntil: "load"`, then a `waitForTimeout` of 3000 ms. The site auto-fills the form and **auto-submits the search immediately on page load** — no `click` calls needed. After the wait, the `lib-connection-results` element holds a `listbox: Routenergebnisse` with `option:` rows. Each option's accessible name has the shape `Departure HH:MM - Arrival HH:MM Duration NN Min … Take the S-Bahn SX in the direction of {term} … +N Minuten Verspätung`. Parse those fields out of the a11y tree (don't rely on visual CSS classes — they're shadow-DOM Wastl components).

**Browser caveats**:

- The autocomplete dropdown is NOT in the accessibility tree — a `snapshot` won't see the suggestion list when typing in the stop fields. The deep-link URL bypasses this entirely.
- `?fromStation=de:09162:2&toStation=de:09162:100` style globalId deep-links do **not** auto-fill the form — only the textual `?from=…&to=…` variant works.
- The driver daemon tends to hang after rapid sequential `fill / press ArrowDown / press Enter` cycles against the form fields. The deep-link path is more reliable than scripting the typeahead.
- The website's form-submit does not change the URL — results render in-place via XHR, so you cannot recover the result URL after a manual fill+submit.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **No auth, no anti-bot, no proxy needed.** Verified 200s direct from a bare sandbox IP for both `/api/bgw-pt/v3/locations` and `/api/bgw-pt/v3/routes`. Stealth + residential proxy adds latency without changing the result.
- **`fib/v2/*` and `fib/v3/*` are dead paths** — both return the MVG 404 HTML page wrapped in a 200 response (the page is 200; its body is the 404 view). Don't waste time on them. The only working API prefix in 2026-05 is `/api/bgw-pt/v3/`.
- **`routingDateTime` requires UTC with explicit `Z`**. `2026-05-21T08:00:00.000Z` works; bare `2026-05-21T08:00:00` and `…+02:00` both return 400. The server applies Munich TZ (`Europe/Berlin`, CET/CEST) internally — `08:00Z` in summer becomes `10:00` Munich local.
- **The query param is `originStationGlobalId` (camelCase, `Station` in the middle).** Variants like `originGlobalId`, `fromStationGlobalId`, `origin` all return `400 You must provide either station global id or coordinate for origin`. Get the casing wrong and you get nothing.
- **Munich has four distinct "Hauptbahnhof" stops with different `globalId`s** — `de:09162:6` (U-Bahn/Tram), `de:09162:100` ("München Hbf" S-Bahn/regional-rail), `de:09162:7000` (Hauptbahnhof Nord), `de:09162:5000` (Hauptbahnhof Süd). A naive routing between the first two yields a 16-minute _walking_ route because they're on opposite ends of the station complex. When the user says "Hauptbahnhof", ask which mode they're using, or default to `de:09162:100` (S-Bahn entrance) for arrivals and `de:09162:6` (U-Bahn entrance) for departures depending on context.
- **Non-existent `globalId` returns `200 []` silently.** No 4xx error, no warning — just an empty array. Always validate that the locations call returned a real match before passing the id to `/routes`, and check `routes.length > 0` before assuming success.
- **Empty `locations.query=` returns `400 getLocations.query: must not be blank`** — the only documented validation error. Treat as user-input error, prompt for a non-empty query.
- **Top-level `distance` and per-part `distance` are in meters** (floats). The Munich U-Bahn/S-Bahn ring averages 1–2 km between adjacent inner stops; trips with `distance > 30000` are likely crossing into MVV outer zones or out of MVV entirely.
- **No `plannedArrival` field.** The last leg's `to.plannedDeparture` doubles as the trip's arrival timestamp. (Yes, it's named `plannedDeparture` even on the destination — that's an API quirk, not a typo.)
- **`ticketingInformation.zones: []` means out-of-MVV.** Cross-network trips (Munich Hbf → Ingolstadt, Munich → Nürnberg via S-Bahn + Regional) return parts populated but no zone info, because the MVV tariff doesn't apply. The `unifiedTicketIds` list is the canonical answer for in-zone fares — `STK-K-1` is a single short trip, `TKK` is a Kurzstrecke, `BT-XY` are day tickets, `E365J`/`E365M` are the Deutschland-Ticket annual fares.
- **`viaStationGlobalId` parameter is accepted (200) but does not appear to enforce the via stop** — observed `isViaStop: false` on all intermediate stops in the response, and the routes returned didn't go through the requested via. If a strict via-stop constraint matters, post-filter routes whose `parts[i].intermediateStops[]` or part boundaries actually include the via id.
- **`refreshId` is an opaque token for the website's auto-refresh feature** — base64+gzip blob with internal state. Not stable across calls; don't try to parse, just pass through if you're proxying the response for the website's UI.
- **Real-time delays only on the day-of.** Routes scheduled for tomorrow or later return `realTime: false` and omit `*DelayInMinutes` fields entirely. Don't promise live delays on multi-day-ahead plans.
- **The MVG marketing site does not expose this API in its docs.** It's a private endpoint powering the public `verbindungen.html` widget. It can change without notice — the `bgw-pt/v3` namespace replaced an older `fahrinfo` API around 2024. If queries start returning 404, check the network tab of `verbindungen.html` for the current path.
