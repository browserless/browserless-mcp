# Compare Ranked Products on RankReason

## Purpose

Research and recommend products using RankReason's source-led editorial rankings. Given a product category or buyer need, this skill finds the relevant ranking list, compares the top-ranked products, explains _why_ each product earned its rank (weighted scoring criteria + reasoning), surfaces per-product pros/cons and "best for / not for" fit notes, and identifies the best product for a user's specific requirements. Read-only. RankReason is a static editorial site — it returns research, not live marketplace data (no live price, availability, ratings, review counts, stock, coupons, or seller info).

## When to Use

- "What's the best `<category>`?" — e.g. best air fryer, robot vacuum, portable power station, handheld game console, organic lipstick, gas grill, beach tent, air purifier.
- Comparing the top 2–3 ranked products in a category to pick one for a specific use case (small kitchen, family meals, RV backup power, quiet bedroom, etc.).
- Understanding _why_ a product was ranked where it was — the weighted scoring breakdown and editorial reasoning.
- Pulling a single product's pros/cons, verified specs, owner-sentiment themes, and source citations.
- Finding a head-to-head comparison/explainer article between two specific products.

## Workflow

**Recommended method: HTTP fetch of static JSON + Markdown — no auth, no stealth, no proxy.** RankReason is purpose-built for AI agents: it advertises a discovery catalog and publishes reviewed Markdown dossiers and compact JSON indexes that are CDN-cached with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`. The data endpoints returned `200` with full content with **no proxy and no stealth**. In Browserless, run these fetches through `browserless_function`: navigate the page to the origin once (`page.goto('https://rankreason.com/')`), then `page.evaluate(async () => fetch('/data/agent-index.json').then(r => r.json()))` — it is same-origin and the endpoints send `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`, so it just works. (`browserless_function` runs in a browser page context, not Node, so the page must navigate to the origin before any `fetch` gains network egress. For the `.md` dossiers use `r.text()` instead of `r.json()`.) Driving the rendered HTML UI works too but costs ~100× more turns and adds nothing — every fact on the HTML page is in the `.md` alternate. Lead with the fetch path; the browser flow is a documented fallback only.

1. **Bootstrap from the agent index.** Fetch `https://rankreason.com/data/agent-index.json`. This compact map is the single best starting point: it lists every `currentRankings` entry (title, `categorySlug`, `rankingSlug`, `period`, HTML `url`, and `markdownUrl`), the focused index URLs, Markdown URL conventions, content counts, and the site's data limitations.

2. **Locate the relevant ranking.**
   - If the user's category maps directly to a `currentRankings[]` entry, use its `markdownUrl`.
   - For broader lookup, fetch `https://rankreason.com/data/rankings-index.json` (full ranking list) or `https://rankreason.com/data/categories-index.json` (taxonomy: `categoryHubs` for browsing + `categories` product-class slugs used by ranking URLs).
   - Markdown convention: current ranking = `/rankings/<rankingSlug>.md`; archived ranking = `/rankings/<rankingSlug>/<period>.md` (`period` is `2026` annual or `2026-05` monthly).

3. **Read the ranking Markdown** at `https://rankreason.com/rankings/<rankingSlug>.md`. This is the core artifact and usually answers the whole question. It contains:
   - A **Methodology** table — scoring criteria with weights (e.g. Cooking performance 30%, Capacity 24%, …).
   - A **Ranked list** table — `Rank | Product | Score | Product dossier` (each dossier is a relative `/products/<slug>.md` link).
   - A **Ranking reasoning** section per product — a "why it ranks here", a short review, a buy/skip **Verdict**, and explicit "why it stays above #N" / "tradeoff versus #N" pairwise comparisons. This is the "understand why products were ranked" payload.

4. **Drill into product dossiers** for the contenders you're comparing: `https://rankreason.com/products/<productSlug>.md`. Each dossier has: rank + score backlink, short review, verdict, full review, **Score breakdown** table (per-criterion score + weight), **Pros**, **Cons**, **Best for**, **Not for**, **Verified facts** (with confidence levels), synthesis/owner-sentiment themes, and a cited **Source list**. Use `data/products-index.json` to look a product up by name/brand and see all its `rankingAppearances` (position + score per ranking).

5. **Check for a head-to-head article.** For "X vs Y" questions, fetch `https://rankreason.com/data/articles-index.json` first — it lists comparison/explainer articles with `relatedProductSlugs` and `markdownUrl` (`/articles/<articleSlug>.md`). Use it before falling back to rankings + product pages.

6. **Synthesize the recommendation.** Map the user's stated requirements to the scoring criteria and each product's "Best for / Not for" notes. The #1 rank is the best all-around pick, but the reasoning section explicitly calls out when a lower-ranked product is the better fit for a narrower need (e.g. single-basket simplicity, small footprint, budget). Cite the RankReason Markdown/HTML URLs you used, and explicitly note that live price/availability require a separate retailer check.

### Browser fallback

Only if the JSON/Markdown endpoints are unreachable. Use a `browserless_agent` call and attach a residential proxy (`proxy: { proxy: "residential" }`) — the homepage HTML sits behind Cloudflare — then `goto` the target and read it:

- `https://rankreason.com/rankings/` — index of all rankings.
- `https://rankreason.com/rankings/<rankingSlug>/` — ranking detail (same content as the `.md`).
- `https://rankreason.com/products/<productSlug>/` — product dossier.
  Each HTML page exposes a `rel="alternate"` Markdown link and also serves Markdown when requested with `Accept: text/markdown`. There is also an optional WebMCP layer: in a WebMCP-capable browser the page exposes tools `rankreason.search`, `rankreason.get_ranking`, `rankreason.get_product_review`, `rankreason.get_article`, `rankreason.get_agent_entrypoints`, and `rankreason.navigate` for structured read-only access.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **The data endpoints have no anti-bot.** Despite the homepage sitting behind Cloudflare (the host probe flagged `likelyNeedsProxies: true` for `/`), every `/data/*.json` and `/rankings|products|articles/*.md` endpoint returns `200` on a plain same-origin fetch with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` and `Cache-Control: public`. Do not attach a proxy on the fetch path — it is unnecessary. A proxy is only relevant for the browser-rendered HTML fallback.
- **Start with `agent-index.json`, not `search-index.json`.** The agent index is the compact, intended entrypoint. `search-index.json` is a broad UI-oriented page index that can be large — fetch it only for open-ended site-wide search when the focused indexes don't answer the task.
- **No live marketplace data — by design.** RankReason explicitly does NOT publish live price, availability, ratings, review counts, seller/offer details, shipping, coupons, badges, or promotions. Never infer these from RankReason content. If the user needs them, say a live retailer check is required.
- **Affiliate links never decide rankings** — rankings are source-led editorial. Treat scores/reasoning as the authority, not any outbound retail links.
- **Two-layer taxonomy.** `categoryHubs` (e.g. "Home & Living", "Kitchen & Dining") are editorial/navigation parents. `categories` (product-class slugs like `air-fryers`, `robot-vacuums`, `organic-lipstick`) are what ranking URLs, product `categoryIds`, and Markdown manifests actually use. Map a user's category to the product-class slug, not the hub.
- **"Ranking angles" live in the slug/title, not the taxonomy.** Intents like "for small kitchens" or "without titanium dioxide" are encoded in the ranking slug/title and reasoning text, not as separate category slugs.
- **Catalog is small and dated.** At capture time (May–June 2026) there were 8 current/published rankings, 8 product-class categories, 9 category hubs, 80 reviewed products, and 1 article. Each ranking carries an explicit `period` (e.g. `2026-05`) and `Published`/`Updated` dates — surface the date so the user knows the recency. If a category isn't covered, say so rather than improvising.
- **Prefer Markdown over HTML.** When `markdownUrl` is present in an index it is the cleanest, lowest-token source. Fall back to HTML (or `Accept: text/markdown`) only when reviewed Markdown isn't published for a target.
- **Pairwise reasoning is embedded.** The ranking `.md` includes "Why it stays above #N" and "Tradeoff versus #N" lines per product — use these for the head-to-head comparison rather than re-deriving from raw scores.
