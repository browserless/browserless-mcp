# Bay Club Location Info Scraper

## Purpose

Aggregate structured, per-location gym information from `bayclubs.com` for a wellness/health platform: club name, full street address (city, state, ZIP), phone, email, weekly operating hours (Sun–Sat, including "closed" days), and the **club-specific** amenity list. Bay Club is a ~33-location chain of athletic/fitness/golf clubs across California, Washington, and Oregon. The site is a statically-rendered Webflow site — all of this data is present in the initial HTML, so a residential-proxy HTTP fetch + parse is the fast, cheap, reliable path. Read-only; never submits the "Visit a club" lead form.

## When to Use

- Building or refreshing a directory of Bay Club locations with addresses, hours, and offered amenities.
- Comparing amenities across locations (e.g. "which clubs have a pool / spa / pickleball?").
- Periodic re-sync of hours and contact info into an aggregator.
- Any flow that would otherwise scrape Bay Club club pages — the HTML is static, so skip a full browser unless your HTTP path is blocked.

## Workflow

The recommended method is **fetch through a residential proxy + HTML parse** — no JavaScript execution is required. Every field lives in the server-rendered HTML. A bare (non-proxy) request intermittently gets a Cloudflare "Just a moment" interstitial (HTTP 200 but challenge body, no real content), so route the fetch through a residential proxy: a `browserless_agent` call with the top-level arg `proxy: { proxy: "residential" }` (repeat the `proxy` arg on **every** call — the session persists across calls, keyed by `proxy`/`profile`, so a call that drops or changes the proxy lands in a different session), navigating with `{ "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "<url>", "waitUntil": "load" } }` and then reading the HTML via `{ "method": "html", "params": { "selector": "body" } }` (or parse in-page with `evaluate`).

### 1. Enumerate all locations

Fetch the locations index and harvest every club URL:

```
GET https://bayclubs.com/locations        (via residential proxy)
```

Extract club detail links with the regex `href="(/clubs/[^"]+)"` and de-dupe. This yields **33** locations (the authoritative list — it is a superset of `/sitemap.xml`, which omits `pro-club-seattle` and `griffinclub`). `/sitemap.xml` is an alternative enumeration source but trust `/locations`.

### 2. Fetch each club page

```
GET https://bayclubs.com/clubs/{slug}      (via residential proxy)
```

### 3. Parse the "HOURS & LOCATION INFO" block

Locate the literal heading text `HOURS & LOCATION INFO`. Immediately after it:

- **Weekly hours** — seven lines `Sun:`, `Mon:`, … `Sat:`. Each value is either `H:MM am - H:MM pm` or the literal `closed`. **The colon may be followed OR preceded by whitespace** — match `Day\s*:\s*(closed|\d{1,2}:\d{2}\s*[ap]m\s*-\s*\d{1,2}:\d{2}\s*[ap]m)` (e.g. Griffin Club renders `Sun : 6:00 am - 9:00 pm`). Note invisible zero-width / `‍` joiner characters separate the lines — strip them.
- **Address** — the block between the `Sat:` hours value and the literal `Phone:`, in the form `{Club Name} {street} {City}, {ST} {ZIP}`. The club name prefix duplicates the page `<title>`; strip it to get the clean street+city line. **There is no comma between street and city**, so don't try to split them — keep the line whole and parse `state`/`zip` from the `, {ST} {ZIP}` tail.
- **Phone** — `Phone:\s*([0-9().\- ]{7,20})`.
- **Email** — `Email:\s*([\w.%+\-]+@[\w.\-]+\.\w{2,})`.

### 4. Parse the "CLUB AMENITIES" grid (club-specific)

The amenity list that is _specific to that club_ is a Webflow CMS collection. Each card is an anchor:

```html
<a
  class="clubamenities_linkblock ..."
  data-category="Fitness Centers"
  href="/amenities/fitness-center"
  >…</a
>
```

Collect the `data-category` attribute (the display name) and the `href` (`/amenities/{slug}`) from every `clubamenities_linkblock` anchor. De-dupe by name. Amenity counts vary by club (observed 4–29), confirming these are club-specific.

**Do NOT** derive amenities from `/amenity/{slug}` (singular) hrefs on the page — those are an identical global footer/nav block present on _every_ club page (always the same ~25 links) and are NOT the club's actual offering. The club-specific signal is the `clubamenities_linkblock` / `data-category` cards, whose target hrefs use the **plural** `/amenities/{slug}`.

### 5. Emit one record per club

See **Expected Output**. Cross-validated: parsing 33 club pages yielded fully structured records for 31; see Gotchas for the 2 exceptions.

### Browser fallback

If the proxied fetch path is unavailable, a headless browser produces the identical data (cross-validated to the exact same 21 amenities + hours + address for `sanfrancisco`):

1. `browserless_agent` with `{ "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "https://bayclubs.com/clubs/{slug}", "waitUntil": "load" } }` (a plain agent call passed Cloudflare without a proxy in testing; add the top-level `proxy: { proxy: "residential" }` arg if challenged).
2. Dismiss the Usercentrics cookie banner (`{ "method": "click", "params": { "selector": "..." } }` on the `OK` button) if it overlays content.
3. `{ "method": "snapshot" }` — the page exposes a full accessibility tree (~458 refs). Read the `HOURS & LOCATION INFO` text and the `CLUB AMENITIES` grid labels (ALL-CAPS in the snapshot; title-case them when emitting).

This costs ~100× the fetch path per page for zero extra data — use only as a fallback.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **Residential proxy for the fetch.** A bare GET returns `200` but sometimes serves a Cloudflare "Just a moment" / challenge body (no real content). A `browserless_agent` call with `proxy: { proxy: "residential" }` was reliable across all 33 pages. (Pre-run probe flagged `cloudflare` + `recaptcha`; reCAPTCHA was never actually triggered on read-only GETs.)
- **Two PRO Club locations live off-domain.** `https://bayclubs.com/clubs/pro-club-seattle` and `/clubs/proclub-bellevue` return **HTTP 301** redirecting to `https://www.proclub.com/club/...`. They have no usable data on bayclubs.com — either follow the redirect and parse proclub.com separately, or flag them `success:false, reason:"offsite_redirect"`. All other 31 clubs render fully on bayclubs.com.
- **Hours colon spacing is inconsistent.** Most clubs render `Sun:` but at least one (Griffin Club) renders `Sun :` (space before colon). Use a whitespace-tolerant regex or you'll silently drop all 7 days for that club.
- **Zero-width joiner noise.** The hours lines are separated by `‍`/zero-width characters; normalize whitespace (`\s+ → " "`) before regex-matching or day boundaries get fuzzy.
- **ZIP ≠ first 5-digit number.** Several addresses begin with a 5-digit street number (e.g. Fremont `46650 Landing Parkway`, Portland `18120 SW…`). Parse ZIP from the `, {ST} {ZIP}` tail, not the first `\d{5}` in the block, or you'll capture the street number.
- **One club spells out the state.** `crowcanyon` renders `Danville, California` (full state name, no ZIP in the tail) instead of `, CA 94526`, so the 2-letter `state`/`zip` extraction returns null there. `address_raw` is still captured intact — fall back to it. All other CA/WA/OR clubs use the 2-letter form.
- **Amenities: plural vs singular path is the whole ballgame.** Club-specific amenities = `clubamenities_linkblock` cards → `data-category` name + `/amenities/{slug}` (plural) href. The `/amenity/{slug}` (singular) and `/new-amenities/{slug}` links are global nav/footer and are identical on every page — using them gives every club the same bogus 25-item list.
- **No JSON-LD / structured-data block.** The pages carry no `application/ld+json`. `/page-json` and `/faq-json` are _not_ JSON endpoints — they're ordinary Webflow HTML pages titled "page-json"/"faq-json". Don't waste time trying to hit them as APIs.
- **Hosting fingerprint.** Webflow behind Cloudflare (`X-Wf-Region`, `Surrogate-Key: pageId:…`, `cdn.prod.website-files.com`). Content is fully pre-rendered; there is no client-side data API to discover.
- **Read-only.** Each club page embeds a "Visit a club" lead-capture form (First/Last name, email, phone, club picker). Never fill or submit it.
- **Embedded Google Map may error.** The map iframe sometimes shows "Oops! Something went wrong" — irrelevant to data extraction; the textual address is the source of truth.
