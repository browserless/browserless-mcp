# Look Up Scout Product, Pricing, Integration, and Use-Case Info

## Purpose

Read-only research skill that retrieves structured product, pricing, integration, customer, and use-case information from **scoutos.com** given a topic (e.g. "RFP agent", "Salesforce integration", "enterprise pricing", "AI sales engineer"). Returns a JSON envelope containing feature descriptions, pricing tier details (plan name, price, included quotas, target user), supported integrations/connectors, named customer logos and testimonials, relevant use-case page URLs, and the canonical source URL for every field. Also drives the demo-booking Cal.com modal and the free-trial signup at `studio.scoutos.com/onboarding/step-1` **up to but not including form submission**, returning the captured form state. Nothing is purchased, scheduled, or submitted.

## When to Use

- A user asks "What does Scout cost?" / "Is there an enterprise tier?" / "Free trial limits?"
- A user asks whether Scout integrates with a specific tool (Salesforce, HubSpot, Slack, Notion, MCP, etc.).
- A user wants a feature breakdown of Scout Agents, Databases, or Workflows.
- A user names a use case ("RFP responses", "competitive intel", "AI sales engineer", "security questionnaire") and wants to know what Scout offers and the canonical landing page.
- A user wants customer logos, named testimonials, or case studies for social proof.
- A user wants to walk through the demo-booking or free-trial signup flow without actually scheduling or registering (e.g. to confirm field labels, see the calendar host, verify the Clerk identity provider).

## Workflow

Scoutos.com is a **Next.js + Sanity CMS** marketing site with **no anti-bot, no captcha, no login wall, and a public sitemap.xml**. Server-rendered HTML carries the full body content, so the cheapest, fastest path is a **`browserless_agent` `goto` + `html`/text fetch** for any read-only field. Drive an interactive `browserless_agent` session **only** when you need to interact with elements (FAQ accordions that are collapsed by default, the Cal.com demo-booking modal, or the Clerk signup form fields on `studio.scoutos.com/onboarding/step-1`).

### 1. Resolve the topic to a canonical URL set

Start from the sitemap and the in-nav route map. Both work without a browser:

```json
{ "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "https://www.scoutos.com/sitemap-0.xml", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } }  // then { "method": "html", "params": { "selector": "html" } } — full URL inventory
{ "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "https://www.scoutos.com/", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } }              // then html — nav links live in the HTML
```

The site's top-nav route map (canonical for the human-facing UI):

- **Product**: `/product/agents`, `/product/databases`, `/product/workflows`
- **Use cases**: `/use-cases/ai-sales-engineer`, `/use-cases/competitor-intel-agent`, `/use-cases/rfp-agent`, `/use-cases/ai-meeting-prep`, `/use-cases/security-questionnaire-agent`
- **Resources**: `/academy`, `/webinars`, `/blog`, `/integrations`, `https://docs.scoutos.com`, `/changelog`
- **Company**: `/customers`, `/partners`
- **Pricing**: `/pricing`
- **Customer stories**: `/customers/{slug}` (current slugs: `dagster`, `quipli`, `statsig`, `wide-awake`)
- **Integration detail**: `/integrations/{slug}` (see Site-Specific Gotchas for the full slug list)
- **Sign up (free trial)**: `https://studio.scoutos.com/onboarding/step-1`
- **Log in**: `https://studio.scoutos.com/sign-in`

Topic → URL heuristics:

- "RFP", "RFP agent", "RFP response" → `/use-cases/rfp-agent`
- "AI sales engineer", "SE bot" → `/use-cases/ai-sales-engineer`
- "Competitive intel", "battle card" → `/use-cases/competitor-intel-agent`
- "Meeting prep" → `/use-cases/ai-meeting-prep`
- "Security questionnaire", "SOC2", "vendor questionnaire" → `/use-cases/security-questionnaire-agent`
- "Agents", "AI agent platform" → `/product/agents`
- "Databases", "vector store", "knowledge base storage" → `/product/databases`
- "Workflows", "no-code workflows", "AI workflow" → `/product/workflows`
- "Pricing", "free tier", "enterprise pricing", "cost" → `/pricing`
- "Customers", "case studies", "logos" → `/customers` + `/customers/{slug}`
- "{Vendor} integration" (Salesforce, HubSpot, Slack, Notion, MCP, Linear, GitHub, Google Drive, Airtable, Attio, Pipedrive, etc.) → `/integrations/{slug}`
- "Government", "public sector", "FedRAMP" → `/solutions/public-sector`

### 2. Fetch the resolved pages and parse fields

For each canonical URL, fetch the HTML and extract the requested fields. The page bodies render server-side, so a single `browserless_agent` `goto` + `html` per URL is enough. If you want clean text instead of raw HTML, add a `text` command on `body`/`main`, or fold the parsing into an `evaluate` that returns only the projected fields — but only do this when the delta matters (e.g. parsing nested testimonial card markup).

Field-extraction map per page:

| Topic field              | Source URL                                                                     | What to parse                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

To read the answers programmatically you **must open a remote browser and click each FAQ button** (see Site-Specific Gotchas)                                                                                                                          |

### 3. (Optional) Demo-booking flow

When the request includes "walk through the demo-booking flow":

One `browserless_agent` call (residential proxy), all commands in one call:

```json
{ "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "https://www.scoutos.com/", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } }
{ "method": "snapshot" }                                              // locate the "Book a 15-min demo" button ref
{ "method": "click", "params": { "selector": "..." } }               // the "Book a 15-min demo" button (resolve selector from snapshot)
{ "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 3000 } }           // Cal.com modal mounts into a child iframe
{ "method": "snapshot" }                                              // the modal is a Cal.com embed; iframe URL is
                                                                      // https://app.cal.com/connorhardy/30min/embed?...
```

The modal is an iframe-embedded Cal.com event titled **"Scout Chat (30 Min)"** hosted by `connorhardy`. Despite the button reading _"15-min"_, the underlying Cal.com slot is **30 minutes long** — capture this honestly in the returned `demo` object. Return the available date buttons and time slots from the iframe accessibility tree; do **not** click any time slot or fill the booking form.

### 4. (Optional) Free-trial signup flow

```json
{ "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "https://studio.scoutos.com/onboarding/step-1", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } }
{ "method": "snapshot" }
// Page is Clerk-hosted. Use the fresh refs from the snapshot:
{ "method": "type", "params": { "selector": "<email-textbox>", "text": "user@example.com" } }
{ "method": "type", "params": { "selector": "<password-textbox>", "text": "<password>" } }
// DO NOT click Continue. DO NOT toggle the ToS checkbox.
{ "method": "screenshot" }
```

Use `type` for plain example values as shown. If you ever drive this with real vault credentials (only when the user asked and creds are in scope), load the `autonomous-login` skill and pass secrets via `loadSecret` — never inline a real secret in a `type` command.

Captured form state to return:

- `email` (string), `password` (string, mask when echoing back),
- `tos_accepted` (boolean — `false` unless the user explicitly asked you to toggle the checkbox),
- `provider_buttons_available`: `["GitHub", "Google", "Email + Password"]`,
- `identity_provider`: `"Clerk"` (constant for this page).

The form is gated by a Clerk widget; submission triggers email verification and would create a real workspace. Stop at the filled-but-not-submitted state.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **No anti-bot — bare fetch works.** Five consecutive plain `browserless_agent` fetches (no proxy) returned 200 OK. There is no Cloudflare, Akamai, or captcha gate. `robots.txt` is permissive (`Allow: /`). You generally do **not** need an interactive session for read-only fields; reserve it for FAQ accordion expansion, the Cal.com modal, and the Clerk signup form.
- **Two route prefixes for the same content: `/use-cases/{slug}` vs `/solutions/{slug}`.** The top nav advertises `/use-cases/...` (the human-facing path), but the sitemap-0.xml uses `/solutions/...` (the legacy path). Both return 200 for the same content (e.g. `/use-cases/rfp-agent` and `/solutions/rfp-agent` both work). **Prefer `/use-cases/{slug}` as the canonical user-facing URL** — that's what the site nav uses today. The `/solutions/...` URLs are still live but not surfaced in the chrome. Note: a few sitemap-only slugs (`/solutions/ai-chatbot`, `/solutions/scout-for-shopify`, `/solutions/public-sector`, `/solutions/knowledge-base`, etc.) are **not** mirrored under `/use-cases/...` — they only exist under `/solutions/...`. Treat `/solutions/...` as the superset and `/use-cases/...` as the curated subset.
- **`/use-cases` (no slug) is a 404.** There is no index page at `/use-cases`. Use the sitemap or the nav menu for discovery.
- **Pricing has only TWO tiers, not three.** Don't fabricate a "Pro" or "Team" plan. The plan menu is exactly:
  - **Free to try** — `$0/month`, 1 seat, 200 agent messages, 3 active workflows, 50 workflow runs, 1 GB storage, 2 integrations, 1 hour of logs, community support. CTA → `https://studio.scoutos.com/onboarding/step-1`.
  - **Scale** — `Custom` (contact sales). Dedicated support with SLA, unlimited seats, custom limits across the board, pay by invoice, custom integrations, white-glove agent build. CTA → opens the Cal.com modal.
    No mid-tier exists. The FAQ confirms: _"Scout's pricing scales with your usage — not seat count. … To get a custom quote, schedule a demo and we'll talk pricing to your team size and needs."_
- **Homepage FAQ answers are NOT in the static HTML.** The eight `<h3>` questions on `/` render as collapsed accordions. To extract the answer text you must run a `browserless_agent` session: `snapshot` to find each FAQ button ref, `click` it to expand, then re-read the text/`html`. Just reading the HTML gives you the questions only. The "How much does Scout cost?" answer is what's verifiable up front; the others (e.g. _"Who's NOT a good fit for Scout?"_) require clicks.
- **Two "Book a 15-min demo" buttons → 30-min Cal.com slot.** The label is misleading. Both buttons (hero CTA and footer CTA) trigger a Cal.com modal iframe at `https://app.cal.com/connorhardy/30min/embed` whose event is titled **"Scout Chat (30 Min)"** hosted by Connor Hardy. The "Get in touch" link in the nav has `href="#"` and dispatches the same modal via JS — it's not a real anchor.
- **`/onboarding/step-1` is on `studio.scoutos.com`, not `www.scoutos.com`.** Watch the host swap. The page is Clerk-hosted (logo URL is `img.clerk.com/...`). Form widgets are mounted by `<co-pilot>` and Clerk scripts, so refs change on every reload — always `snapshot` immediately before a `type`/`click`.
- **Selectors/refs must be re-resolved after every navigation.** A navigation invalidates prior `snapshot` refs — re-`snapshot` before each `type`/`click` so you're acting on current refs.
- **Integration list is paginated.** `/integrations` shows 18; `/integrations/page/2` adds 2 more (statsig, twilio) — total 20 integrations as of capture. Confirmed slug set: `airtable`, `attio`, `discord`, `github`, `google-calendar`, `google-drive`, `google-search`, `http-request`, `hubspot`, `linear`, `mcp`, `notion-mcp`, `paypal`, `pipedrive`, `rectrac`, `salesforce`, `slack`, `square-up`, `statsig`, `twilio`. Re-check sitemap for new additions.
- **Three integrations have category overlap.** HubSpot, Linear, and Slack appear in BOTH `/integrations/category/agent-tools` and `/integrations/category/workflow-blocks`. Treat `category` as an array, not a single value.
- **Customer-story slugs are a tiny set.** Only four `/customers/{slug}` pages exist today: `dagster`, `quipli`, `statsig`, `wide-awake`. The homepage carousel mentions additional logos (Common Room, Hyper, Citibot, CaseStatus, Modal, Amplitude, SurrealDB, Case Status, Dig South, Deno, QXO) that are **logo-only** with no dedicated case-study page — return them as `logos`, not as `case_studies`.
- **Apex `scoutos.com` 308-redirects to `www.scoutos.com`.** Always use the `www.` host or follow redirects. Don't hardcode the apex.
- **Site is run on Vercel and uses Sanity CMS for image assets.** Logos and integration tile images are served from `cdn.sanity.io/images/0cfe0chk/production/...`. The `0cfe0chk` is the Sanity project ID and is stable; you may use it to recognize and de-duplicate logos across pages.
- **No public marketing/product JSON API.** There is no `/api/products`, no GraphQL endpoint, and no documented REST surface for marketing-page content. The product API (`docs.scoutos.com`) covers the _workflow runtime_, not the marketing catalog. Don't waste time fishing for a content API — fetch the HTML pages directly.
- **Read-only rules.** Never click a slot button inside the Cal.com modal, never click "Continue" on the onboarding form, never check the ToS checkbox unless the user explicitly asks, never click chat-widget "Send" if you open the "Open chat" button. The skill returns _the state of the form_, not a booking or a registration.

## Expected Output

The skill returns one JSON envelope per request. Shape depends on which subsections were requested, but the structure is consistent across calls. Source URLs are mandatory for every field for citation/audit.
