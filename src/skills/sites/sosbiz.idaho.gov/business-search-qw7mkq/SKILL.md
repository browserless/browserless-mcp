# Idaho SOS Business Search

## Purpose

Search the Idaho Secretary of State business registry (`sosbiz.idaho.gov`) by name or file number and return matching entities with their filing number, entity type, status, standing, filing date, and registered agent. Optionally hydrate each hit with full filing details (principal/mailing address, registered agent address, AR due date, term of duration, formation jurisdiction). Read-only — never files, amends, reinstates, or pays AR fees.

## When to Use

- "Look up `<business name>` on the Idaho SOS registry and return its status / agent / filing date."
- Bulk verification of Idaho corporate registrations (active vs dissolved, good vs not-good standing).
- Resolving an Idaho file number (10-digit `RECORD_NUM`) to an entity record.
- Pulling registered agent name + address for an Idaho LLC/corp.
- Discovering all Idaho filings whose name _starts with_ or _contains_ a keyword (e.g. `"smith ventures"` → 2 starts-with matches, 5 contains matches).

## Workflow

The Idaho SOS site at `sosbiz.idaho.gov` is a React SPA that talks to a public, unauthenticated JSON API on the same origin. **There is no API key, no token, no anti-bot wall** — Cloudflare sits in front but only does a passive challenge that any plain browser session (no residential proxy, no stealth) clears on first page load. After the initial `/search/business` navigation seeds `cf_clearance`, subsequent same-origin `fetch()` calls from the page context return JSON immediately. The direct browser-UI path costs ~3× more turns and adds nothing — lead with the API.

**Why the browser page context is the working POST path:** the API is POST-only and Cloudflare-fronted, so a raw HTTP client would need a valid `cf_clearance` cookie tied to its TLS/JA3 fingerprint to POST successfully. Running the request from inside a real browser page sidesteps that entirely: `browserless_function` executes in a browser page context (not Node), so once you `page.goto('https://sosbiz.idaho.gov/search/business')` the page is a legitimate Cloudflare-cleared, same-origin caller — and an in-page `fetch()` inherits `cf_clearance` plus the correct `Origin`/`Referer`. Note the runtime constraint: a bare `fetch()` has no network egress until the page has navigated to the origin, so the `goto` is mandatory before the `page.evaluate` fetch. Because the fetch is same-origin it needs no CORS grant.

### 1. Navigate to seed CF clearance, then search — one `browserless_function` call

`browserless_function` runs your code in a browser page context. Navigate once to `/search/business` to clear Cloudflare and establish the same-origin egress, then run the search `fetch()` in-page. Keep the nav + fetch in the **same call** so the `cf_clearance` cookie persists:

```js
// browserless_function — search
export default async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://sosbiz.idaho.gov/search/business', {
    waitUntil: 'load',
    timeout: 45000,
  });
  const result = await page.evaluate(async () => {
    const r = await fetch('/api/Records/businesssearch', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        Accept: 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        SEARCH_VALUE: 'smith ventures',
        STARTS_WITH_YN: false, // false = substring/contains; true = name-starts-with
        ACTIVE_ONLY_YN: false, // true to hide Inactive-Dissolved / Inactive-Lapsed records
      }),
    });
    return { status: r.status, body: await r.json() };
  });
  return { data: result, type: 'application/json' };
};
```

No residential proxy, no stealth flags needed — a plain session works. Verified across iter-1 (proxied + stealth) and iter-2 (plain), identical API response.

### 2. Response shape

The search returns (note `body` is already parsed JSON above; shown here as returned by the endpoint):

```json
{
  "template": [
    { "label": "Form Info", "id": "TITLE" },
    { "label": "Status", "id": "STATUS" },
    { "label": "Filing Date", "id": "FILING_DATE" },
    { "label": "Agent", "id": "AGENT" }
  ],
  "rows": {
    "919070": {
      "SORT_INDEX": 0,
      "TITLE": [
        "M Smith Ventures, LLC (5577637)",
        "Limited Liability Company (D)"
      ],
      "ID": 919070,
      "FILING_DATE": "02/01/2024",
      "RECORD_NUM": "0005577637",
      "AGENT": "Michael Smith",
      "STATUS": "Inactive-Dissolved (Administrative)",
      "STANDING": "Not Good Standing",
      "ALERT": false,
      "CAN_REINSTATE": true,
      "CAN_FILE_AR": true,
      "CAN_FILE_REINSTATEMENT": false
    },
    "...": {}
  }
}
```

`rows` is an **object keyed by `ID`** (not an array). To get an ordered list, iterate `Object.values(rows)` and sort by `SORT_INDEX` ascending — the server returns them pre-sorted by relevance/filing-date, but key iteration order is not guaranteed in older JS environments. No results returns `rows: {}` (empty object, **not** `null` and **not** `[]`).

### 3. (Optional) Hydrate each hit with full filing details

For each `ID` in `rows`, run the detail `fetch()` in the same page context. If you kept the page from step 1 alive (same `browserless_function` call), it is already Cloudflare-cleared and same-origin — just `page.evaluate` the detail fetches; otherwise `page.goto('https://sosbiz.idaho.gov/search/business')` first. You can loop all IDs inside one `page.evaluate` and return the batch:

```js
// browserless_function — detail hydration (page already navigated to sosbiz origin)
export default async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://sosbiz.idaho.gov/search/business', {
    waitUntil: 'load',
    timeout: 45000,
  });
  const ids = [874134]; // the ID values from step 2's rows
  const details = await page.evaluate(async (ids) => {
    const out = {};
    for (const id of ids) {
      const r = await fetch(`/api/FilingDetail/business/${id}/false`, {
        headers: { Accept: 'application/json' },
      });
      out[id] = { status: r.status, body: await r.json() };
    }
    return out;
  }, ids);
  return { data: details, type: 'application/json' };
};
```

URL pattern: `GET /api/FilingDetail/business/{ID}/false`. The trailing `/false` is the `includeImageDetails` flag — the UI calls it with `false` on drawer expand and `true` only when the user opens the full filing-image gallery (which is an authenticated path we don't need). Returns:

```json
{
  "DRAWER_DETAIL_LIST": [
    {
      "LABEL": "Filing Type",
      "VALUE": "Limited Liability Company (D)",
      "ALERT_YN": false
    },
    { "LABEL": "Foreign Name", "VALUE": null, "ALERT_YN": false },
    {
      "LABEL": "Status",
      "VALUE": "Inactive-Dissolved (Administrative)",
      "ALERT_YN": false
    },
    { "LABEL": "Formed In", "VALUE": "IDAHO", "ALERT_YN": false },
    { "LABEL": "Term of Duration", "VALUE": "Perpetual", "ALERT_YN": false },
    {
      "LABEL": "Principal Address",
      "VALUE": "8230 W WINCHESTER DR\nBOISE, ID 83704",
      "ALERT_YN": false
    },
    {
      "LABEL": "Mailing Address",
      "VALUE": "8230 W WINCHESTER DR\nBOISE, ID 83704-7059",
      "ALERT_YN": false
    },
    {
      "LABEL": "Initial Filing Date",
      "VALUE": "04/13/2023",
      "ALERT_YN": false
    },
    {
      "LABEL": "Inactive Filing Date",
      "VALUE": "07/06/2024",
      "ALERT_YN": false
    },
    { "LABEL": "AR Due Date", "VALUE": "04/30/2024", "ALERT_YN": true },
    {
      "LABEL": "Registered Agent",
      "VALUE": "Noncommercial\n0289212\nAaron  Smith\n8230 W WINCHESTER DR\nBOISE, ID  83704",
      "ALERT_YN": false
    }
  ],
  "HIDE_CERT_BUTTON": false,
  "HIDE_REQUEST_ACCESS": false,
  "HIDE_HISTORY": false,
  "HIDE_AMENDMENT_BUTTON": false,
  "AR_BUTTON_LABEL": null
}
```

The `DRAWER_DETAIL_LIST` is an **ordered array of label/value pairs**, not a keyed object — extract values by `LABEL` string match (e.g. `list.find(d => d.LABEL === 'Principal Address')?.VALUE`). Some entries (e.g. `Foreign Name`) have `VALUE: null` when not applicable. `Inactive Filing Date` is only present for dissolved/lapsed records. `ALERT_YN: true` flags fields the UI renders in red (typically a past-due AR Due Date).

No session-release step — there is nothing to release. Keep the nav + search + (optional) detail fetches inside ONE call's flow so the `cf_clearance` cookie and page origin stay together across the fetches; the session itself persists across calls (keyed by config) rather than dying on return, but batching avoids re-navigating to re-seed `cf_clearance` each time.

### Browser fallback

If the in-page `fetch()` path is unavailable or the API endpoint changes, drive the UI with `browserless_agent` (pass the goal plus these commands):

1. `{ "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "https://sosbiz.idaho.gov/search/business", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } }`
2. `{ "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 2000 } }`
3. `{ "method": "snapshot" }` — locate the textbox (label: `Search by name or file number`) and the `Execute search` button (confirm the refs via `snapshot` if selectors miss).
4. `{ "method": "type", "params": { "selector": "<textbox>", "text": "smith ventures" } }` then `{ "method": "click", "params": { "selector": "<Execute search button>" } }`.
5. `{ "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 2500 } }` then `{ "method": "snapshot" }` — results render in a `<table>` with columns `Form Info | Status | Filing Date | Agent`. Each row's `Form Info` cell is a `button: <Name> (<Record#>) <Filing Type>  Click to expand`.
6. Parse the table rows directly from the snapshot tree. To expand details: `{ "method": "click", "params": { "selector": "<row button>" } }` and re-`snapshot` the drawer.

The UI's default behaviour matches **STARTS_WITH_YN=true** — i.e. it only surfaces records whose name _begins with_ the query (e.g. `"smith ventures"` shows 2, not 5). If you want substring/contains matches via the UI, click `Advanced Search Options` and uncheck the starts-with toggle. The API path lets you set this directly on the request body — prefer it.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **The site is a React SPA** — `https://sosbiz.idaho.gov/` and `/search/business` return an empty `<div id="root">`. Static HTML scraping is pointless; you must either drive the rendered DOM via `browserless_agent` (`snapshot`) or call the JSON API directly from the page context.
- **`GET /api/Records/businesssearch` → 405**, with `Allow: POST` and an XML error body (`<Error><Message>The requested resource does not support http method 'GET'.</Message></Error>`). The API is POST-only.
- **No auth, no CSRF token, no anti-bot.** A plain session (no residential proxy, no stealth) works after one navigation to seed CF cookies. Verified across 2 iters: identical responses with and without stealth/proxy. Do not waste cost on a proxy or stealth for this site.
- **The POST must originate from a Cloudflare-cleared, same-origin caller** — so the working path is an in-page `fetch()` via `browserless_function` after `page.goto` seeds `cf_clearance`. A raw HTTP client would need a matching `cf_clearance` cookie (tied to its TLS fingerprint) to POST successfully; the browser page path avoids that. Running from any environment that already has a valid `cf_clearance` cookie, plain `curl -X POST` against the API works fine — and most sessions don't even need that, since the CF challenge here is opportunistic, not mandatory.
- **`STARTS_WITH_YN: true` is the UI default**, but the API defaults to **false** when the field is omitted (verified: omitting the field returned 5 contains-matches for `"smith ventures"`, identical to `STARTS_WITH_YN: false`). Always set the field explicitly to avoid drift if the server changes.
- **`rows` is an object keyed by record `ID`, not an array.** Iterate via `Object.values(rows)` and sort by the per-row `SORT_INDEX` field for the canonical UI ordering.
- **Empty result set returns `rows: {}` (empty object), not `null` or `[]`.** Branch on `Object.keys(rows).length === 0`.
- **`TITLE` is a 2-element array**, not a single string: `[<Display Name> (<Filing Number>), <Filing Type>]`. The filing number embedded in element 0's display string is the same value as `RECORD_NUM` but with leading zeros stripped — `"M Smith Ventures, LLC (5577637)"` vs `RECORD_NUM: "0005577637"`. Use `RECORD_NUM` for exact comparisons.
- **Two different IDs per record:** the `ID` field (e.g. `919070`) is the internal database key used for `/api/FilingDetail/business/{ID}/false`; the `RECORD_NUM` (e.g. `"0005577637"`) is the public-facing 10-digit file number (zero-padded string). Don't confuse them — passing `RECORD_NUM` to the detail endpoint will 404.
- **Detail endpoint trailing flag is `/false`**, not omitted. `GET /api/FilingDetail/business/{ID}` (no flag) returns 404. The flag is `includeImageDetails`; `false` returns the lightweight drawer payload, `true` returns image-gallery metadata that requires an authenticated session.
- **`DRAWER_DETAIL_LIST` is positionally ordered but labeled** — match by the `LABEL` string, not by array index. Some labels are conditional (e.g. `Inactive Filing Date` only appears for dissolved/lapsed records; `Foreign Name` is `null` for in-state filings).
- **Registered Agent VALUE is a newline-delimited multi-line string** containing `Agent Type\nAgent ID\nAgent Name\nStreet\nCity, State Zip`. Split on `\n` (literal `\n` in the JSON string, which is `\n` newline after parse) to break into fields. Agent names are often double-spaced internally (e.g. `"Aaron  Smith"`, `"Brian M Smith"`) — normalize whitespace if joining tokens.
- **Status enum** (observed during iter-1): `Active-Existing`, `Active-Current`, `Inactive-Dissolved (Administrative)`. `Active-Existing` is for ongoing corporations/LLCs; `Active-Current` is for Assumed Business Names (DBAs). `STANDING` mirrors this: `Good Standing` ↔ Active, `Not Good Standing` ↔ Inactive.
- **`ALERT_YN: true` on a `DRAWER_DETAIL_LIST` entry** = the UI renders that field in red and surfaces an alert badge — typically a past-due `AR Due Date`. Treat as a soft compliance signal.
- **Filings cover multiple entity classes**: LLCs (`Limited Liability Company (D)` where `(D)` = domestic), corporations, Assumed Business Names, and (per the nav bar) Notary, Liens (UCC), Trademark, Franchise Authority. Each has its own search surface — this skill is scoped to `business` only. UCC liens are at `/search/ucc`, notaries at `/search/notary`, etc.
- **The site sets an `ASP.NET_SessionId` cookie on first request** but the API does not validate it server-side — verified by deleting the cookie and re-POSTing successfully. Session affinity is opportunistic only.
