# Caravan Group — Cross-Border Trucking Capacity & Quote Request

## Purpose

Given a Canada↔USA cross-border freight shipment of interest, return (a) Caravan Group of Companies' **published capacity profile** (asset-based fleet inventory, brokered/3PL coverage, equipment types, geographic lanes, terminal network, certifications) and (b) the **canonical path to obtain pricing** — Caravan does **not** publish real-time rates on the website, so "pricing" resolves to either a populated/staged Rate Request submission or the published toll-free / e-mail contact channels with a structured rate-request payload. Read-only: never click _Get a Rate!_ — stop after the form is staged or after fetching the public capacity pages.

## When to Use

- A shipper / broker wants to know whether Caravan covers their lane, equipment type, or commodity before contacting sales.
- A 3PL / TMS integration needs to populate a carrier-capability record for Caravan (asset-based + non-asset, fleet count, terminals, bonded status, CTPAT/PIP).
- An agent has been asked "is Caravan a fit for my Canada–US load, and how do I get a quote from them?"
- Any flow that needs to differentiate Caravan's **asset arm** (Caravan Logistics fleet, ~450 tracked power units) from its **non-asset / brokerage arm** ("Caravan's logistics department" with 3PL carrier-partners) — both arms are documented under the same domain.

## Workflow

**Capacity discovery is purely static-HTML fetch — no JavaScript, no anti-bot, no proxy required.** The Caravan site is a WordPress install (Apache + PHP/7.4 + Genesis "business-pro-theme") that serves complete pre-rendered HTML for every services page. A plain HTTPS `GET` (any client) returns the full markup; when browser transport is preferred use a `browserless_agent` `goto` + `text`/`evaluate` to parse in-page. Under restricted egress, `browserless_function` is the fallback (browser page context: `page.goto('https://caravangroup.com/…')` then read/parse the DOM — see the runtime constraint). Pricing, however, is **not exposed online at all** — there is no public rates API and no instant-quote calculator. The only quote path is the JotForm-hosted Rate Request form (CAPTCHA-gated → cannot complete end-to-end without OCR or human-in-the-loop), or the toll-free phone / e-mail. Lead with the fetch path for capacity; for pricing, stage the JotForm payload and either (i) hand the captcha to a human/OCR step, or (ii) emit the structured rate-request bundle alongside the phone/e-mail fallback.

### 1. Capacity & coverage (HTTP GET — no session needed)

The information that answers "what can Caravan haul, on which lanes, with which equipment, asset vs. non-asset?" lives on five static service pages plus a locations page. Fetch them in parallel:

```
GET https://caravangroup.com/services/cross-border/
GET https://caravangroup.com/services/full-truckload/
GET https://caravangroup.com/services/less-than-truckload/
GET https://caravangroup.com/services/temperature-controlled/
GET https://caravangroup.com/services/just-in-time/
GET https://caravangroup.com/services/cross-dock-warehousing/
GET https://caravangroup.com/about/logistics/             # ← brokerage / 3PL arm
GET https://caravangroup.com/contact-us/locations/        # ← terminal network
```

Each page is < 50 KB, returns `200 OK` to a bare `curl` (no `User-Agent` filtering, no Cloudflare/Akamai), and the meaningful prose is inside `<main>...</main>`. Extract by stripping `<style>`, `<script>`, and remaining tags. Key facts to lift, by page:

| Page                               | Facts to extract                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

The asset/non-asset distinction is fundamental to this task: **Caravan operates both models simultaneously and the website surfaces each on a different page.** Do not conflate. Asset-based capacity is the 450-tractor fleet documented on the FTL/LTL/temp/JIT/cross-border pages; non-asset/brokerage capacity is the 3PL-partner network documented on `/about/logistics/`.

### 2. Pricing — stage the Rate Request form

Caravan publishes **no rates anywhere on the public site**. The single online quoting path is `https://caravangroup.com/rate-request/`, which loads a JotForm (form id **`81999264940977`**) via:

```html
<script src="//www.jotform.com/jsform/81999264940977?redirect=1"></script>
```

The form-server source is also directly fetchable at `https://form.jotform.com/81999264940977` and `https://www.jotform.com/form/81999264940977` (both return the same HTML). Use either to discover field structure programmatically rather than driving the embed.

**Field map** (names are the literal `name="..."` attributes JotForm's POST endpoint expects):

**JotForm submit endpoint** (observed in the form's `<form action>`):

```
POST https://submit.jotform.com/submit/81999264940977
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
```

The page also embeds two anti-bot fields that the inline `<script>` populates client-side: `simple_spc = "81999264940977-81999264940977"` (literal) and a hidden honeypot `name="website"` that must remain empty. POSTing without first GETting `/jsform/81999264940977` (to obtain a CAPTCHA session cookie) will be rejected.

**Read-only stop point.** Stage the payload — set every value, validate it against the table above, snapshot the form. **Do not click `Get a Rate!`** unless a human operator has authorized the actual submission and supplied the CAPTCHA text. Submission triggers a JotForm e-mail to Caravan sales and a redirect to `caravangroup.com/rate-request/?redirect=1`; treat it like any irreversible booking-confirmation action — gate it behind explicit authorization.

### 3. Fallback channels for pricing (always include in the response)

Even when the form path succeeds, surface these out-of-band channels — they are how a human rep ultimately replies, and they are the only realistic path when CAPTCHA-driven automation is not available:

- **Toll-free**: `1-888-828-1727` (24/7 Oakville HQ; quote desk hours not published but support is 24/7).
- **General e-mail**: `info@caravangroup.com` — e-mail with the same field set the form collects (origin, destination, pickup date, commodity, weight, FTL vs LTL, comments).
- **Customer login (existing accounts only)**: `https://caravanlogistics.freightassist.com` — a FreightAssist TMS instance. Requires credentials issued by Caravan; the public site does not offer self-service signup. Useful to mention but unreachable for a new prospect.

### Browser fallback

If the JotForm embed fails to render (rare — observed reliable across both a plain fetch and a stealth-free browser session in iter-1), `goto` `https://form.jotform.com/81999264940977` directly in a `browserless_agent` call. The form is the same; the wrapping caravangroup.com chrome is the only difference. Drive the fields with `type`/`click` commands against the `name="..."` attributes in the field map above — e.g. `type` `"ACME Corp"` into `[name="q34_companyName"]` for Company Name, `q19_fullName[first]` / `q19_fullName[last]` for the name split, `q22_email` for e-mail, etc. Re-confirm the field refs with a `snapshot` command rather than caching them, since JotForm renumbers its internal element order across page-loads.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **Asset vs non-asset is split across two URLs.** The asset-based fleet (~450 tractors) is described on every `/services/*` page. The non-asset/brokerage arm is **only** on `/about/logistics/`. An agent that fetches only the services menu will silently miss the 3PL capability. Always include `/about/logistics/` when the prompt mentions "non-asset", "brokerage", or "3PL".
- **The LTL radio value is byte-truncated.** The `q31_capacity31` LTL option's literal `value` attribute is `"Less Than Truck Load (LTL"` — closing `)` is missing. Confirmed in both the raw `/jsform/` HTML and the browser-rendered iframe. Submit it character-for-character or the option will not register.
- **`q33_numberOf` is hidden by default.** JotForm hides the skids/pallets input until the LTL radio is clicked. Direct POSTs can include it unconditionally; browser-driven flows must click the LTL radio first or the field stays `display:none`.
- **Pickup Date is required per the UI but not flagged in the `jf-required` class list.** Trust the red asterisk in the rendered form, not the static HTML class set. (Iter-1 evidence: screenshot `02-jotform-rendered.png` shows the red `*` next to "Pickup Date" while the source `<li id="id_36">` lacks `jf-required`.)
- **CAPTCHA blocks pure HTTP automation.** The `<input name="captcha">` is required and validated server-side against an image at `https://cdn.jotfor.ms/...`. There is no Turnstile / reCAPTCHA / hCaptcha bypass; an end-to-end automated submission needs OCR (JotForm CAPTCHAs are simple 5–6 char alphanumerics — feasible with Tesseract or a vision model) or a human-in-the-loop step.
- **`q36_pickupDate` accepts `mm-dd-yyyy`, not ISO.** The placeholder in the rendered input is literally `mm-dd-yyyy`. Sending `2026-06-15` will fail HTML5 validation client-side; split into `month=06`, `day=15`, `year=2026`.
- **Country dropdown default is United States.** Both `q20_shipmentOrigin[country]` and `q27_shipmentDestination[country]` pre-select `United States`. Cross-border-from-Canada loads must explicitly set origin country to `Canada` — otherwise the rep gets a malformed inquiry that needs follow-up to disambiguate.
- **`/customer-login` is not a public path.** The footer's "CUSTOMER LOGIN" link goes off-domain to `caravanlogistics.freightassist.com`. Do not waste turns trying to use it for prospect quote discovery; it is a TMS portal for existing accounts.
- **The map at `/service-map/` is a Google-Maps embed via the `uscanadahtmlmap` WP plugin — pin data is not in the page HTML.** If you need the actual terminal lat/lons, scrape them from the locations text on `/contact-us/locations/` (full addresses listed in plain text) and geocode separately. The map UI is for human eyes only.
- **WordPress / WooCommerce vestigials.** The site bundles a WooCommerce store (`/caravan-shop/`) and a Site-Kit GA tag (`GT-5NGV43ZG`). The currency reported by `googlesitekit.wcdata.currency` is `"GBP"` — leftover misconfiguration; **do not treat as a pricing signal**. All actual quotes are in USD or CAD per the rep, not GBP.
- **No `robots.txt` Disallow blocks the service pages.** Fetching with a plain `User-Agent` works; a `browserless_agent` `goto` (optionally with a residential `proxy` arg) is more than sufficient for any rate-limit safety margin. Stealth / residential proxy are not needed here.
- **The toll-free 1-888-828-1727 is the same across every Canadian terminal page.** Each terminal also lists a direct local number; for sales/quote the toll-free is the right channel. (Calgary uses a different toll-free, `1-800-268-3045`, but routes to the same dispatch.)
- **No instant-rate API has been confirmed.** Checked: no JSON endpoint under `/wp-json/`, no GraphQL surface, no `/api/`, no `/rate-quote.php`. The FreightAssist back-end likely has one (FreightAssist is a Trimple/McLeod-style TMS) but it is not exposed to anonymous traffic. **Do not waste iterations probing for one** — confirmed absent.
