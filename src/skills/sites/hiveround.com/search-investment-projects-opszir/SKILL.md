# Search Hiveround Investment Projects

## Purpose

Discover live startup raises an investor could put money into on [Hiveround](https://hiveround.com), optionally filtered by free-text keyword, funding stage, and maximum raise size, and return each match as structured data (slug, name, stage, sector, raise amount, one-liner, listing URL). This is a **read-only** discovery task — it lists/searches public raises and does not request intros, watch projects, or move money. Hiveround is an agent-native marketplace: it ships an MCP server, an ECP JSON API, and markdown representations specifically so agents can read raises without scraping HTML.

> **Transport note (Browserless):** This is a plain HTTPS JSON / JSON-RPC interface — the `curl` and GET examples below are canonical and run from any client. Only under restricted egress, route via `browserless_function`, which executes in a browser page context: `page.goto('https://hiveround.com/')` first, then `page.evaluate` a same-origin `fetch` POST to `/api/mcp` (same-origin, so it works without CORS). Never route API keys through the browser gratuitously — the anonymous read tools need none.

## When to Use

- "Find new projects to invest in on Hiveround" / "What's raising right now?"
- "Show me prototype-stage AI startups raising under $500k."
- "Search Hiveround for fintech raises" or "list the newest live raises."
- Building an investor pipeline: enumerate candidates before doing diligence (`get_project` returns the full pitch.md per slug).
- Any time you need the structured raise feed rather than a human-readable page.

## Workflow

The fastest, most reliable path is the **Hiveround MCP server** — the site explicitly tells agents to use it instead of crawling (`/llms.txt`). All read tools are anonymous (no API key).

### Recommended: MCP server (`POST /api/mcp`, JSON-RPC 2.0)

1. **Optionally confirm tools** with `tools/list`. The read tools are:
   - `list_projects` — newest open raises (args: `limit`≤25, optional `stage`). No query needed.
   - `search_projects` — keyword search across name, one-liner, description, sector (args: **`query` required**, optional `stage`, `max_raise_usd`, `limit`≤25).
   - `get_project` — full listing by `slug`, including the founder's GitHub handle and the entire pitch markdown in `description`.
2. **Call the tool.** To search prototype-stage projects matching "AI":
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://hiveround.com/api/mcp \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
     -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"search_projects","arguments":{"query":"AI","stage":"prototype","limit":10}}}'
   ```
   For an unfiltered feed, swap in `{"name":"list_projects","arguments":{"limit":10}}`.
3. **Parse the response.** The JSON-RPC envelope's `result.content[0].text` is itself a JSON string — parse it to get `{ "projects": [ … ] }`. Each project has the fields in Expected Output below.
4. **(Optional) drill in** with `get_project` per `slug` to pull the full pitch markdown for diligence.

`stage` is one of `idea | prototype | mvp | launched | revenue`. `max_raise_usd` is a number in USD.

### Alternative: ECP JSON / markdown over plain GET (no POST, no JS)

If you can't make a JSON-RPC POST, the same data is content-negotiable over GET — works through a simple HTTP fetcher and residential proxy:

- **Structured JSON:** `GET https://hiveround.com/api/ecp/projects?q=AI&stage=prototype&max=500000` → `application/ecp+json` with a `Collection` whose `items[]` are full `Project` objects (same fields as MCP plus the pitch `description`).
- **Markdown list:** `GET https://hiveround.com/projects?q=AI&stage=prototype` with header `Accept: text/markdown` → a clean markdown digest of matching raises with listing links.
- `GET https://hiveround.com/llms.txt` is a hand-maintained summary of the marketplace + every live raise's one-liner — good for a quick overview, and `llms-full.txt` inlines the full corpus.

### Browser fallback

Only needed if both HTTP paths are blocked. The human page mirrors the same query params, so you rarely need to script the form. Drive it with a single `browserless_agent` `commands` array (the session persists across calls, keyed by `proxy`/`profile`):

1. `{ "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "https://hiveround.com/projects", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } }` — or jump straight to `https://hiveround.com/projects?q=AI&stage=prototype&max=`, since the query params drive the results directly.
2. If using the form: `{ "method": "type", "params": { "selector": "input[name=\"q\"]", "text": "AI" } }`, then `{ "method": "select", "params": { "selector": "select[name=\"stage\"]", "value": "prototype" } }`, then `{ "method": "click", "params": { "selector": "<the filter button>" } }` (confirm the selector via `snapshot` if it misses).
3. `{ "method": "snapshot" }` or `{ "method": "text", "params": { "selector": "body" } }` to read the result cards. The result count renders as "N LIVE".
4. There is a **"VIEW AS JSON"** link on the page — following it lands you back on the ECP JSON above, so prefer that over scraping cards.

Note: a `goto` issues a GET, so it **cannot** call the MCP endpoint (which needs a POST). To exercise MCP under restricted egress, use `browserless_function`: `page.goto('https://hiveround.com/')` first (to establish the origin + network egress), then `page.evaluate` an async same-origin `fetch('/api/mcp', { method: 'POST', headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json', 'Accept': 'application/json, text/event-stream' }, body: … })` and return `r.json()` — same-origin, so no CORS issue.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **Agent-native by design.** The homepage `Link` header and `/.well-known/api-catalog` advertise: MCP (`/api/mcp`), ECP (`/.well-known/ecp`, `/ecp.json`), an agent-skills index (`/.well-known/agent-skills/index.json`), an MCP server card (`/.well-known/mcp/server-card.json`), and `/llms.txt`. Start from `/llms.txt` if you're unsure of the interface — it names the MCP tools directly.
- **MCP needs the streaming Accept header.** The transport is `streamable-http`; include `Accept: application/json, text/event-stream` or the POST may be rejected.
- **`result.content[0].text` is double-encoded.** MCP tool results wrap the payload as a JSON string inside the JSON-RPC envelope — parse twice.
- **`search_projects` requires `query`.** Calling it without `query` errors; use `list_projects` when you want everything.
- **Read vs. write auth.** `list_projects`, `search_projects`, `get_project` are anonymous. `request_intro`, `watch_project`, `update_watch`, `list_watches`, and the intro-thread tools require a Bearer API key (`hr_sk_*`) generated at https://hiveround.com/mcp. This skill only uses the anonymous read tools.
- **`limit` caps at 25** for `list_projects`/`search_projects`. There were only ~5 live raises total at capture time, so paging rarely matters, but the ECP GET endpoint also exposes `page`/`page_size` for larger catalogs.
- **Keyword search is broad.** `search_projects`/`q=` matches across name, one-liner, _description_, and sector — so "AI" returned 4 of 5 raises (including ones whose sector isn't literally "AI") because the term appears in their pitch bodies. Don't assume a hit means the sector field equals your query.
- **`sector` and `founder.*` can be null.** Anonymous founders return `founder.handle/display_name/github_url = null`; some listings have `sector = null`. Don't treat these as errors.
- **Cloudflare fronts the site but does not block agents.** `robots.txt` allows `/projects` and sets `Content-Signal: ai-train=yes, search=yes, ai-input=yes` for every named AI agent (incl. ClaudeBot/Claude-User). `robots.txt` _disallows_ `/api/`, but `/api/mcp` and `/api/ecp/*` are the documented, advertised agent interfaces — that Disallow targets crawlers, not the intended programmatic clients. No captcha, login wall, or 4xx anti-bot pattern was observed across two traced iterations; a residential proxy (`proxy: { proxy: "residential" }` on the `browserless_agent`/`browserless_function` call) was sufficient and full stealth/verification was **not** required.
- **No POST from a `goto`.** Confirmed during iteration 1 — a plain navigation to `/api/mcp` only returns the server card (a GET). Use `curl`/`fetch`, or a `browserless_function` same-origin `fetch` POST, for the actual JSON-RPC call.

## Expected Output

`search_projects` / `list_projects` (after unwrapping `result.content[0].text`):

```json
{
  "projects": [
    {
      "slug": "seminara",
      "name": "Seminara",
      "one_liner": "Seminara is an AI-hosted session platform for education-led sales and onboarding through real-time voice interaction and orchestration.",
      "stage": "prototype",
      "sector": "Enterprise SaaS",
      "raise_amount_usd": 150000,
      "raise_instrument": "Open to discussion",
      "monthly_revenue_usd": null,
      "url": "https://seminara.online/",
      "logo_url": "https://.../project-logos/.../...png",
      "founder": { "handle": null, "display_name": null, "github_url": null },
      "posted_at": "2026-05-10T20:45:08.865415+00:00",
      "listing_url": "https://hiveround.com/projects/seminara"
    }
  ]
}
```

A convenient task-level shape to emit to a caller:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "method": "mcp",
  "query": "AI",
  "stage": "prototype",
  "max_raise_usd": null,
  "count": 4,
  "projects": [
    {
      "slug": "seminara",
      "name": "Seminara",
      "stage": "prototype",
      "sector": "Enterprise SaaS",
      "raise_amount_usd": 150000,
      "one_liner": "Seminara is an AI-hosted session platform…",
      "listing_url": "https://hiveround.com/projects/seminara"
    },
    {
      "slug": "elastova",
      "name": "Elastova",
      "stage": "prototype",
      "sector": "AI & Agents",
      "raise_amount_usd": 250000,
      "one_liner": "AI recovery agent for loose skin after major weight loss.",
      "listing_url": "https://hiveround.com/projects/elastova"
    },
    {
      "slug": "watta",
      "name": "watta",
      "stage": "prototype",
      "sector": null,
      "raise_amount_usd": 250000,
      "one_liner": "ai workout tracker for rowers…",
      "listing_url": "https://hiveround.com/projects/watta"
    },
    {
      "slug": "arispay-executive-summary",
      "name": "ArisPay",
      "stage": "prototype",
      "sector": "Fintech",
      "raise_amount_usd": 2000000,
      "one_liner": "The settlement layer for agentic commerce.",
      "listing_url": "https://hiveround.com/projects/arispay-executive-summary"
    }
  ],
  "error_reasoning": null
}
```

`get_project` adds a `description` field containing the full pitch markdown. On no matches, return `count: 0` with an empty `projects` array (not an error). On failure, `success: false` with `error_reasoning` populated from the response.
