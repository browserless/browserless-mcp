# AZGFD Hunting Intel Extraction

## Purpose

Pull a structured snapshot of _current_ hunting intelligence from the Arizona Game and Fish Department (AZGFD) — season regulations PDFs by species, the next/last draw deadlines and most recent draw results, Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) detection status, the next and most-recent commission meeting (with agenda PDF), predator management updates (Mexican gray wolf population count, mountain lion), habitat / road / access closures, and any pending or just-effected rule changes (Article 3 / Article 4 / Article 10).

The skill is **read-only**: it discovers and reads canonical pages, regulation PDFs, news releases, and commission agendas. It must never apply for a draw, purchase a license, or submit harvest reports.

## When to Use

- A hunter-facing agent answering "what's open right now in Arizona?" or "what's the next big-game draw deadline?"
- A regulatory intelligence agent monitoring Arizona's pending rule packages (Article 3/4/10), Article amendments effective dates, and Governor's Regulatory Review Council (GRRC) status.
- A wildlife / conservation news agent tracking Mexican wolf annual population counts and Q1–Q4 wolf incident updates.
- A road / access agent surfacing fire-related, breeding-season, or hatchery closures that affect hunters.
- Periodic refresh of an "AZGFD dashboard" tile in a wider hunting-state catalog.

Do **not** use this for: shopping for a guide, individual draw-odds lookup by hunt code (use a separate `draw.azgfd.com` lookup skill), license purchase, harvest reporting, or pulling the _full text_ of regulation PDFs (this skill returns the PDF URL + publish date; downstream consumers parse the PDF body).

## Workflow

The AZGFD site is **Cloudflare-protected** with a managed challenge that fires on bare HTTP fetches. The HTML endpoints — `www.azgfd.com`, `draw.azgfd.com` — must be reached from a stealthed `browserless_agent` session with a residential `proxy`; the `azgfd-portal-wordpress-pantheon.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com` PDF host is open (no CF) and takes a plain HTTPS GET.

There is no public REST/GraphQL API. AZGFD does ship a sitemap (`https://www.azgfd.com/sitemap_index.xml`), which is useful for URL discovery, but the structured intel itself lives in HTML news posts and on a handful of canonical pages.

### 1. Stealth + residential proxy, one call

Drive the canonical pages with a single `browserless_agent` call carrying `proxy: { proxy: "residential" }` on a stealthed session — a bare session (no proxy) is fronted by Cloudflare's "Just a moment…" challenge HTML. All the canonical pages sit behind the same CF cookie once warm, so keep them in the one call's `commands` array (batching keeps them on the warmed CF session and avoids extra round-trips). If a page still shows the challenge after `goto`, add `{ "method": "solve", "params": { "type": "cloudflare" } }`.

### 2. Walk the canonical pages (single call — they're all behind the same CF cookie once warm)

For each page below: `{ "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "<url>", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } }`, then `{ "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 6000 } }` (the CF challenge resolves in 4–7s on first hit), then read the page text with `{ "method": "text", "params": { "selector": "body" } }` (or an `evaluate` that returns the article body) and parse:

| Intel category                      | Canonical URL                                                                                                                                                                       | What to extract                                                                                                                                                                                               |

### 3. Pull the latest news posts for emergency closures, pending rules, predator updates

AZGFD's WordPress front page paginates as `/<YYYY>/<MM>/<DD>/<slug>/`. Use the **`browserless_search`** tool (query `site:azgfd.com 2026 <topic>`) to enumerate recent posts — this is much cheaper than crawling the news index. Run one search per topic:

- `browserless_search`: `site:azgfd.com 2026 wolf population`
- `browserless_search`: `site:azgfd.com 2026 draw results`
- `browserless_search`: `site:azgfd.com 2026 amendment proposed rule`
- `browserless_search`: `site:azgfd.com 2026 closure fire restriction`
- `browserless_search`: `site:azgfd.com 2026 commission meeting`

For each top result, `goto` it in the stealthed session and read the page text (the `text` method on `body`, or an `evaluate`). Trim to the article body by slicing from the `# <Title>` line through the next `### Subscribe` heading (those headings survive in the text). The publish date is in the first line of body content as `Month DD, YYYY` and matches the URL slug.

### 4. Map to species-season status

The "open / closed / upcoming" status for the seven species in the prompt is computed from the regulations PDFs, **not** from any HTML page — AZGFD does not publish a per-species "open/closed today" tile. Cite the PDF URL + the season-window quoted from the PDF's table (e.g., "Bull elk archery: 2026-09-11 through 2026-09-24") and let the consumer compute open/closed against today's date. Mapping:

| Species                      | Primary regulation PDF                                  |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |

| Elk                          | 2026 Pronghorn and Elk Regulations                      |

| Reptiles / amphibians        | 2026-2030 Reptile and Amphibian Regulations             |

### 5. No session release needed

There is no release step. A `browserless_agent` session persists across calls, keyed by `proxy` — a later call with the same `proxy` reconnects to the same warmed browser with the CF cookie intact. Keep the whole page-walk in one call's `commands` array anyway, to save round-trips and avoid accidentally dropping the `proxy` config (which would land you in a different, cold session).

### Optional fast path for PDFs only (skip Cloudflare entirely)

The regulation PDF host `azgfd-portal-wordpress-pantheon.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com` is a plain AWS S3 bucket with no CF in front. Once you have a PDF URL (discovered via step 2 above, or carried over from a prior run), a plain HTTPS GET works — bare `curl` from any client, or `browserless_function` (`page.goto(pdfUrl)` returning a `{ data, type: "application/pdf" }` block) under restricted egress. No stealthed browser or proxy needed. This is the cheapest path when the goal is to _re-fetch_ a known PDF rather than discover a new one.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **Cloudflare managed challenge.** A bare HTTP GET of `https://azgfd.com/` returns HTTP 403 with the `cf-mitigated: challenge` header. A stealthed `browserless_agent` session with a residential `proxy` passes the challenge automatically (add a `solve` `cloudflare` command if it lingers) but takes 4–7 seconds on the first hit per session; subsequent navigations in the same call are cookie-bound and fast (`__cf_bm` cookie). Budget the warm-up cost into the first page load.
- **The page text includes the Google Translate language picker** — a ~5KB tail of every language name in every language. Slice from `# <Page Title>` to `### Subscribe to our Newsletter` to get the actual article body.
- **`commission-meeting-agendas/` (with the `s`) is a 404 trap.** The canonical URL is `commission-agendas/` (no `meeting-`). The site exposes the shortcut `https://www.azgfd.com/commagenda` which redirects to the right slug — prefer the shortcut when hand-coding.
- **`/commission` and `/commagenda` shortcuts.** Several news posts reference `www.azgfd.gov/commission` and `www.azgfd.gov/commagenda` (note `.gov`, not `.com`). These redirect to the `.com` canonical pages; following them works, but cache the resolved `.com` URL in your output for stability.
- **Most-recent commission action is in the YouTube video, not in a PDF.** The minutes page lists `[video][audio]` links per meeting but rarely a PDF transcript. To know what the commission _voted on_, transcribe the linked YouTube video or read the next-cycle agenda which references the prior meeting's motions. Workshop meetings (Nov 6–7 retreats, May 12–13 Sipe WLA workshops) _do_ get a PDF.
- **Two parallel CWD URLs exist.** `https://www.azgfd.com/wildlife/wildlife-diseases/cwd/` 404s sometimes; the live canonical is `https://www.azgfd.com/wildlife-conservation/wildlife-diseases-2/chronic-wasting-disease-what-hunters-should-know/`. The `wildlife-diseases-2` segment (with the `-2`) is correct — it's not a typo or staging artifact.
- **CWD status as of 2026-05-29:** Arizona reports "CWD has not been detected in Arizona's deer or elk" on the canonical CWD page. The latest published surveillance report is the FY 2024 Annual CWD Report (uploaded 2024-07-08) and the Final 2024-2025 Annual CWD Report (uploaded 2025-07-02 to the S3 host). If you discover a _positive_ detection news post, surface it under `closures_and_restrictions` with the post URL and date — do not silently flip the status field.
- **PDF upload date is encoded in the S3 URL path.** Pattern: `…/<YYYY>/<MM>/<DDHHMMSS>/<filename>.pdf`. E.g. `2026/05/04081122` = 2026-05-04 08:11:22 UTC. This is more reliable than the PDF's own metadata because the page surrounding the link may not be re-dated when the PDF is re-uploaded.
- **`draw.azgfd.com` is a separate app on a separate hostname.** It has its own CF posture but the same stealth + residential-proxy session passes. Do NOT navigate past the cookies banner — clicking "Enter the Draw" starts an application. Reading the homepage countdown is sufficient.
- **The `accounts.azgfd.com` portal is the only place individual draw results appear** ("A customer's AZGFD portal account is the only source for finding out draw results and viewing bonus points" — from the 2026 elk/pronghorn draw release). This skill cannot retrieve per-applicant draw results; it can only confirm that aggregate draw results have been released by linking the news post.
- **Tag mail dates are written in news posts, not in any structured field.** E.g. "AZGFD expects to mail hunt permit-tags to customers by April 1" appeared in the 2026-02-23 release. Surface as `tag_mail_date` if present in the most recent draw-results post.
- **Article 3 vs Article 4 vs Article 10.** Article 3 = taking wildlife (live trapping, possession). Article 4 = live wildlife (pets/captive wildlife, falconry, desert tortoise). Article 10 = OHV. Pending rule packages are filed under each article separately. As of 2026-05-29: Article 4 amendments effective 2026-02-26; Article 10 amendment process began 2025-10-03. Always cite the specific article when surfacing a "pending regulation" finding.
- **`live-azgfd-main.pantheonsite.io` and `dev-azgfd-main.pantheonsite.io` URLs appear in some inline links.** These are Pantheon staging hostnames that the WordPress editor sometimes embeds; they resolve but are not stable. Rewrite to `www.azgfd.com` paths when storing.
- **Site search box returns the WordPress search REST endpoint** — flaky and rate-limited. Use the `browserless_search` tool (`site:azgfd.com …`) instead; it indexes the same content far more reliably.

## Expected Output

Returned as a single JSON object keyed by intel category. Field-level honesty: any field whose source page returned a Cloudflare wall, a 404, or didn't surface the requested data must be `null` with the cause noted in `error_reasoning`.

If the next commission meeting is unknown (the agendas page lists past meetings only and the next-meeting press release has not yet been published), set `commission.next_meeting` to `null` and add a note in `error_reasoning` rather than guessing the next date. Commission meets monthly except August / October / November (workshop only), so the _implicit_ next meeting after a May 8 regular meeting is typically the following month — but always confirm against a fresh fetch of the agendas page.
