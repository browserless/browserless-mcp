# Find Indian Stocks on Zerodha Markets

## Purpose

Look up Indian stocks (and related instruments) listed on the NSE/BSE by searching for a company name or ticker on Zerodha Markets, and return the matching listed entities with their trading symbol and exchange. This skill is **read-only** — no login, no orders. The fastest reliable path is the JSON search endpoint that the page itself calls (`/markets/stocks/search/?q=<query>`), which returns a clean, structured list of matches; scripted browsing is only a fallback.

## When to Use

- A user wants to find an Indian stock by company name or partial ticker (e.g. "find Reliance stocks", "what's the NSE symbol for Tata Motors?").
- You need to resolve a company name to its **trading symbol + exchange** (NSE/BSE) before doing anything else (charting, quoting, deeper research).
- You need to enumerate the family of listed entities under a brand (e.g. all "Reliance"/"Tata"/"HDFC" companies).
- You need the canonical Zerodha Markets stock-page URL for a company.

Not for: placing orders, portfolio access, or live tick-by-tick quotes (live price is rendered client-side — see Gotchas).

## Workflow

**Recommended method — call the JSON search endpoint directly (`fetch`).** The search box on `https://zerodha.com/markets/stocks/` is powered by `search.js`, which issues a single GET to a JSON endpoint. Hit it directly instead of driving the UI.

1. Issue the GET with `browserless_function`. Because the page runtime has no network egress until it navigates, first `page.goto` the same origin (`https://zerodha.com/markets/stocks/`), then run a same-origin `fetch` inside `page.evaluate` and return the parsed JSON. No authentication, cookies, or special headers are required, and residential proxies are **not** needed — the endpoint returns `200 application/json` directly, so omit the `proxy` arg.

   ```js
   // browserless_function — code arg
   export default async function ({ page }) {
     const query = 'reliance'; // url-encode the user's query
     await page.goto('https://zerodha.com/markets/stocks/', {
       waitUntil: 'load',
       timeout: 45000,
     });
     const result = await page.evaluate(async (q) => {
       const res = await fetch(
         `/markets/stocks/search/?q=${encodeURIComponent(q)}`,
         {
           headers: { accept: 'application/json' },
         },
       );
       return {
         status: res.status,
         contentType: res.headers.get('content-type'),
         body: await res.json(),
       };
     }, query);
     return { data: result, type: 'application/json' };
   }
   ```

2. Parse the JSON. The response has five arrays:

   ```json
   { "companies": [...], "brands": [...], "index": [...], "ETFs": [...], "MFs": [...] }
   ```

   For "find Indian stocks", the `companies` array is the primary result. Each row:

   ```json
   {
     "display_name": "Reliance Industries",
     "slug": "reliance-industries-limited",
     "symbol": "RELIANCE",
     "exchange": "NSE",
     "category": "brands"
   }
   ```

3. Map each match to its canonical Zerodha Markets page URL (pattern derived from `search.js`):
   - Stock → `https://zerodha.com/markets/stocks/{exchange}/{symbol}/` (e.g. `/markets/stocks/NSE/RELIANCE/`)
   - ETF → `https://zerodha.com/markets/etf/{exchange}/{symbol}/`
   - Mutual fund → `https://zerodha.com/markets/mutual-fund/{symbol}/`
   - Index → `https://zerodha.com/markets/indices/{display_name}`

4. Return the matches (display name, symbol, exchange, slug, and the constructed URL). If all arrays are empty, return an empty result set with `count: 0` — that is a valid "no matches" outcome, not an error.

### Browser fallback

If the JSON endpoint is ever unavailable, drive the page UI with a single `browserless_agent` call. Batch the whole flow (navigate → type → wait → extract) in ONE `commands` array so the page state carries through without an extra round-trip — the session itself persists across separate calls (keyed by the call's `proxy`/`profile`), so there is no separate release step. No proxy needed.

```json
{
  "commands": [
    {
      "method": "goto",
      "params": {
        "url": "https://zerodha.com/markets/stocks/",
        "waitUntil": "load",
        "timeout": 45000
      }
    },
    {
      "method": "type",
      "params": { "selector": "#search", "text": "reliance" }
    },
    {
      "method": "waitForSelector",
      "params": { "selector": "#search_results", "timeout": 10000 }
    },
    { "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 2000 } },
    {
      "method": "evaluate",
      "params": {
        "content": "(()=>{ const rows=[...document.querySelectorAll('#search_results a')].map(a=>({ text:a.textContent.trim(), href:a.getAttribute('href') })); return JSON.stringify(rows); })()"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

- The search input is `#search` (placeholder "Search Stocks or Brands..."); results animate into `#search_results` (allow ~2s for the animation).
- Each result row links to `/markets/stocks/{exchange}/{symbol}/`; filter tabs ("All" / "Companies") sit above the results. Confirm the selectors via a `snapshot` command if the `evaluate` returns nothing.

This returns the same data the JSON endpoint provides, just slower.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **The search API is NOT Cloudflare-gated.** The pre-run probe flags `cloudflare` + `cloudflare-waf` on the `zerodha.com` _root_ homepage, but the `/markets/stocks/` subsite and its `/markets/stocks/search/` JSON endpoint return `200` cleanly **with or without** residential proxies/verified stealth. Don't waste a residential-proxy budget on this endpoint.
- **Empty result is HTTP 200, not 404.** A no-match query (e.g. `?q=zzzqxqx`) returns `{"companies":[], "brands":[], "index":[], "ETFs":[], "MFs":[]}` with status 200. Treat empty arrays as "no matches", never as an error.
- **`exchange` is per-row and can be NSE or BSE.** Don't assume NSE for every result; read the field. Build the stock-page URL from the row's own `exchange`+`symbol`.
- **Brand vs. ticker noise.** Searching a brand term (e.g. `reliance`) returns the whole family of related listed companies (RELIANCE, RPOWER, RELINFRA, RIIL, RCOM, …), not just the flagship. The flagship usually carries `"category": "brands"`. Filter on `display_name`/`symbol` if the user wanted one specific company.
- **`category` field is sparse.** Most rows have `"category": ""`; only marquee/brand entries get `"brands"`. Don't rely on it for filtering — use `symbol`/`display_name`.
- **Live price is client-side.** The individual stock detail page (`/markets/stocks/NSE/RELIANCE/`) renders the current price, % change, and intraday range via JavaScript/websocket — the static HTML shows `--` placeholders. Market cap appears server-side, but a **live quote requires a real browser render**, not a static fetch. This skill is about _finding_ stocks (resolving name→symbol→exchange); for a live quote, open the detail page in a browser.
- **Single-token queries work** (e.g. `?q=hd` returns HDFCBANK, HDFCLIFE, …) — no minimum length enforced in testing.
- **"Powered by Tijori"** — the data/UI is supplied by Tijori Finance; the response shape is stable JSON but is not a publicly documented/contracted API, so treat field availability defensively.
