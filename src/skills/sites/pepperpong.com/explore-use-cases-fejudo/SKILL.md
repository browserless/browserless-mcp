# Pepper Pong Explore Use Cases

## Purpose

Browse `pepperpong.com` and return a structured catalog of the use cases the brand promotes for the game — **where** to play (surfaces / venues), **who** to play with (audience segments), and **who to gift it to** (recipient archetypes) — each with supporting quotes / collateral from the site. Read-only; never adds to cart or proceeds to checkout. Output is a single JSON object with three top-level arrays (`where_to_play`, `who_to_play_with`, `who_to_gift_to`), plus a `themes` summary and `sources` list.

## When to Use

- Marketing / positioning research: "what audiences and venues does Pepper Pong actively market to?"
- Gift-guide / curation workflows: "is this game on-brand for a tailgate gift / office gift / grandparent gift?"
- Lead-in research for a longer brand brief or competitor comparison (vs. Spikeball, PaddleSmash, regular ping pong).
- Pre-purchase decision support: "where could I actually use this thing — does it work in an apartment / at the beach / in an RV?"

## Workflow

The pepperpong.com store is a Shopify-rendered site with no anti-bot. Every page that contains use-case collateral is **server-side rendered** — a `browserless_function` that navigates to the origin and then issues in-page same-origin `fetch` calls returns the same HTML/markup that a scripted browser render does, at ~100× lower cost (no proxy required). Lead with `browserless_function`; only fall back to a `browserless_agent` scripted pass if you need to capture a screenshot of the final structured page.

A residential proxy is **not** required. A stealth session is **not** required — do **not** set `proxy` on the `browserless_function` / `browserless_agent` calls. Cloudflare on this property only enforces basic bot checks; the default Browserless page load passes them.

Lead-path fetch (one `browserless_function`, no proxy). `browserless_function` runs in a **browser page context, not Node** — navigate to the origin **first** so the in-page `fetch` has network egress, then read the five same-origin paths in one `evaluate`. Project each page down to plain text inside the eval; never return raw multi-hundred-KB HTML (the function text return is capped at ~200k chars):

```js
export default async function ({ page }) {
  await page.goto('https://pepperpong.com/', {
    waitUntil: 'load',
    timeout: 45000,
  });
  const paths = [
    '/',
    '/pages/frequently-asked-questions',
    '/products/pepper-pong-full-set',
    '/pages/our-story',
    '/pages/press',
  ];
  const pages = await page.evaluate(async (paths) => {
    const out = {};
    for (const p of paths) {
      const res = await fetch(p, { credentials: 'same-origin' });
      const html = await res.text();
      // strip to text in-page — project, don't ship raw HTML
      out[p] = html
        .replace(/<script[\s\S]*?<\/script>/gi, ' ')
        .replace(/<style[\s\S]*?<\/style>/gi, ' ')
        .replace(/<[^>]+>/g, ' ')
        .replace(/\s+/g, ' ')
        .trim();
    }
    return out;
  }, paths);
  return { data: pages, type: 'application/json' };
}
```

1. **Fetch the five canonical pages** (in this order, lowest → highest information density):
   - `https://pepperpong.com/` — homepage. Most concentrated source. Contains the **"WHERE WILL YOU RALLY"** testimonial carousel (5 named use cases with attributed quotes), the four use-case badges (`TRAVEL FRIENDLY / INSTANT FUN / ANY AGE/SKILL / CAN'T-MISS GIFT`), and the "100,000+ sets sold" social-proof framing.
   - `https://pepperpong.com/pages/frequently-asked-questions` — surface list ("airport floors, wooden decks, flipped-over paddleboards, truck hoods"), household contexts ("RVs, boats, high-alpine yurts"), and the **ball-color → opponent-type matrix** (red Ghost → "aggressive death battles against worst enemies"; green Jalapeño → "casual games against grandma"; yellow Habanero → "everything in between").
   - `https://pepperpong.com/products/pepper-pong-full-set` — product PDP collateral. Contains the explicit venue list: "kitchen tables, patios, tailgates" / "offices to dorms to the lake" / game-night reinvented framing, plus reviewer quotes that surface new use cases (e.g. Christmas gift for adult brother → rivalry use case, grandkids visit).
   - `https://pepperpong.com/pages/our-story` — founder Tom Filippini's recovery story. Source for the **"donate to recovery centers / treatment facilities"** gifting use case, which is operationalized by an application form on the page itself.
   - `https://pepperpong.com/pages/press` — media coverage. Adds the **Denver firefighters teamwork** use case (department-wide camaraderie tool), the **teens-off-phones** use case (HuffPost gift guide framing), and the "Swiss Army Knife of games" portability angle.

2. **Parse the page text for use-case signals.** For each page, read the body text (from the `browserless_function` projection above, or via a `browserless_agent` `text` command with `selector: "body"`) and extract:
   - Named testimonials of the form `"<quote>" — <FirstName L.> <UPPERCASE-USE-CASE-TAG>` on the homepage. Five exist as of 2026-05: `GIRLS TRIPS`, `DINNER PARTIES`, `The Office`, `Holidays`, `Tailgates`.
   - Product-PDP venue blocks (`Game night` / `Tournament-ready` / `Take it everywhere` headings + their captions).
   - FAQ free-form venue lists (look for sentences starting with "Pepper Pong can be played on…" or "We've seen games break out on…").
   - PDP marketing-copy callouts (`Your landlord will never know`, `play during nap time`, `apartment without the neighbors filing a complaint`) — these encode an **apartment / quiet-play** use case that doesn't appear as a named testimonial.

3. **Synthesize three buckets**:
   - `where_to_play`: physical surfaces and venues (kitchen island, camp cooler, truck hood, airport floor, RV, boat, yurt, picnic table, apartment, dorm, office, bar, restaurant, lake, deck, paddleboard).
   - `who_to_play_with`: relational archetypes (girls trips, dinner-party guests, office colleagues, family at holidays, tailgate crew, grandparents/grandkids, adult siblings, teens, firefighter crews, recovery-program peers, beginners vs. competitive players via ball selection).
   - `who_to_gift_to`: gift archetypes derived from review quotes and press (teens addicted to phones, adult siblings with renewed rivalries, grandparents wanting multi-gen play, dads/uncles, college-bound kids for dorms, office gift, RV / boat owners, hosts of dinner parties, treatment-facility donations).

4. **Tag each item with `evidence`** — a verbatim short quote (≤ 180 chars) and the page URL it came from. Skills downstream rely on this to cite the source.

5. **Return the JSON object** described in `## Expected Output`. Do not include the cart / checkout / sale-banner text — that's promotional chrome, not use-case data.

### Browser fallback

If the lead-path fetch returns less content than expected (Cloudflare 5xx, transient block, or a future Shopify config change pulls content into JS-rendered components), run a scripted `browserless_agent` pass. Batch all five navigations into **one** `commands` array to save round-trips — there is no session id to track and no release step. (The session does persist across calls, keyed by `proxy`/`profile`, so if you ever split them, carry the same `proxy` to stay in the same session.)

```json
{
  "commands": [
    {
      "method": "goto",
      "params": {
        "url": "https://pepperpong.com/",
        "waitUntil": "load",
        "timeout": 45000
      }
    },
    { "method": "text", "params": { "selector": "body" } },
    {
      "method": "goto",
      "params": {
        "url": "https://pepperpong.com/pages/frequently-asked-questions",
        "waitUntil": "load",
        "timeout": 45000
      }
    },
    { "method": "text", "params": { "selector": "body" } },
    {
      "method": "goto",
      "params": {
        "url": "https://pepperpong.com/products/pepper-pong-full-set",
        "waitUntil": "load",
        "timeout": 45000
      }
    },
    { "method": "text", "params": { "selector": "body" } },
    {
      "method": "goto",
      "params": {
        "url": "https://pepperpong.com/pages/our-story",
        "waitUntil": "load",
        "timeout": 45000
      }
    },
    { "method": "text", "params": { "selector": "body" } },
    {
      "method": "goto",
      "params": {
        "url": "https://pepperpong.com/pages/press",
        "waitUntil": "load",
        "timeout": 45000
      }
    },
    { "method": "text", "params": { "selector": "body" } }
  ]
}
```

Only if a page 5xx's or throws a Cloudflare challenge should you escalate: add `proxy: { proxy: "residential" }` (optionally `proxyCountry: "us"`) at the top level of the `browserless_agent` call, and add a `{ "method": "solve", "params": { "type": "cloudflare" } }` command right after the offending `goto`. Then run the same text-parsing pass as step 2 above. The browser path costs ~5-10× more than the lead-path fetch (per-page render overhead + proxy egress) but produces identical output — the text the FAQ and product pages return is server-rendered HTML in both cases.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **`/pages/stories` is effectively empty.** Despite being linked from the main nav, the page renders only the header/footer chrome — no stories. Don't waste a fetch on it expecting use-case data. Real customer stories live (a) on the homepage as the "WHERE WILL YOU RALLY" carousel and (b) embedded in product-page reviews on `/products/pepper-pong-full-set`.
- **FAQ headers are click-to-expand on the live page, but the body text returned by the `text` command (or the fetched HTML) contains the fully-expanded answer text** — Shopify renders the accordion content into the DOM at SSR time. No need to click each `<details>` element to harvest the FAQ answers.
- **The five `/pages/*` slugs are stable**: `how-to-play`, `our-story`, `reviews`, `press`, `stories`, `frequently-asked-questions`, `contact-us`. There is no `/pages/use-cases`, `/pages/venues`, or `/pages/who-its-for` — use-case data is **scattered across the homepage + product PDP + FAQ + press**, never centralized. Plan for a multi-page parse.
- **Product PDP ball-color → opponent-type mapping is the only "matchmaking" matrix the brand publishes.** Don't fabricate skill-level mappings; cite the FAQ text directly (`red Ghost → enemies`, `green Jalapeño → grandma`, `yellow Habanero → in-between`).
- **Recovery-center donation is operationalized, not just aspirational.** `/pages/our-story` contains a live application form for treatment facilities to request a free donated set. When listing this as a "who to gift to" use case, link the page and note that it's a brand-sponsored donation flow, not a consumer purchase.
- **Press-quoted use cases ("Denver firefighters", "teens", "loneliness/depression") are framed by third-party journalism**, not first-party Pepper Pong marketing copy. Surface them with the publication and treat the framing as their interpretation, e.g. `evidence_source: "nypost.com via /pages/press"`.
- **No `recommended_method: api`.** Confirmed — there is no public Pepper Pong API or product feed. The Shopify storefront's standard `.json` endpoints (e.g. `/products.json`, `/products/<handle>.json`) return product data but NOT the marketing copy / testimonial content that this skill targets. Don't try them.
- **Banner text changes seasonally** ("Grad Sale | Up To 50% OFF + FREE SHIPPING" on 2026-05-19). The promo banner is at the top of every page's markdown — skip it during use-case extraction.

### Outcome variants

This skill has only one happy-path outcome shape (the JSON above). Edge cases to handle:

- **Promo banner missing or changed** — non-fatal. The promo banner ("Grad Sale | Up To 50% OFF") is informational. If absent, still extract use cases from the body content.
- **A page returns 5xx / Cloudflare challenge** — retry with the scripted `browserless_agent` pass, escalating with `proxy: { proxy: "residential" }` and a `solve { type: "cloudflare" }` command after the failing `goto`. If still failing on a single page, ship what you have with that source omitted from `sources` and a `warnings: ["fetch_failed: <url>"]` field added at the top level.
- **Site adds a new use-case section in the future** (e.g. a dedicated `/pages/use-cases`) — extend, don't overwrite. Append new items to the existing `where_to_play` / `who_to_play_with` / `who_to_gift_to` arrays, keep the evidence-citing convention.
