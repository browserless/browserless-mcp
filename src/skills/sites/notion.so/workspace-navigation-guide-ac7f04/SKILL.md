# Notion Workspace Navigation Guide

## Purpose

Give an agent a working mental model of Notion so it can navigate the product confidently and recognize what each kind of page can do. It covers the entry points and the login wall, the anatomy of a Notion workspace (sidebar, top bar, page/editor body), the navigation primitives an agent uses to move around (search/quick-switcher, the slash `/` menu, breadcrumbs, toggles, database view tabs), and the distinct functionality exposed by the two page archetypes — **doc/page** (blocks) and **database** (views). Read-only orientation skill: it teaches _how to find and recognize_ things, not how to create, edit, or delete content.

## When to Use

- Before driving any Notion task, to orient on where things live (settings, search, a specific page, a database).
- When an agent lands on an unfamiliar Notion page and must classify it (doc vs. database) and figure out what controls are available.
- When deciding whether a Notion request needs the rendered app (navigation, reading a page's structure) or the Notion API/MCP (bulk data CRUD).
- When a flow hits the `app.notion.com/login` wall and the agent needs to know which auth methods exist and what is reachable without an account.

## Workflow

Notion is a UI-first product, so the recommended method is **browser**. Two things shape every Notion session: (1) almost all real workspace content sits behind a login wall, and (2) the only surfaces reachable _without_ credentials are the marketing site, the login page, the help center, and public `*.notion.site` pages. For programmatic data work (creating pages, querying databases) the Notion REST API or hosted MCP is better — but neither helps you "navigate the UI / understand pages," so they are out of scope here (see Gotchas).

### 1. Session setup

Drive Notion with `browserless_agent`. A residential proxy clears Cloudflare on `notion.com` / `app.notion.com` / `*.notion.site`, so set `proxy: { proxy: "residential" }` (optionally `proxyCountry: "us"`) on the call; stealth alone (no proxy) was **not** required in testing. A `browserless_agent` session persists across separate calls, keyed by the call's `proxy`/`profile` config — repeat the same `proxy` arg on every call to reconnect to the same warmed browser (current page, cookies, session all intact); dropping or changing it lands you in a different, blank logged-out session. Batching a multi-step exploration (nav → wait → snapshot → drill in) inside ONE call's `commands` array is a convenience (fewer round-trips, no risk of accidentally dropping the config), not a lifetime rule.

### 2. Know the entry points

| You want…                  | Go to                                                                         |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Marketing / product info   | `https://www.notion.com/` (note: `https://www.notion.so/` 301-redirects here) |
| The app / a workspace      | `https://app.notion.com/` (requires login)                                    |
| Log in                     | `https://app.notion.com/login` (`notion.so/login` lands here too)             |
| Authoritative feature docs | `https://www.notion.com/help` + its category deep-links                       |
| A specific page by URL     | `https://www.notion.so/<workspace>/<Page-Title>-<32charUUID>`                 |
| A public/shared page       | `https://<workspace>.notion.site/<Page-Title>-<UUID>`                         |

### 3. The login wall

`app.notion.com/login` offers: **Email** (type address → `Continue` → emailed code / password / SSO redirect), and SSO buttons **Google, Apple, Microsoft, Passkey, SSO**. There is no guest/demo mode — without an account, stop here and fall back to the public surfaces (steps 5–6). If you have a session, authenticate, then proceed to step 4.

### 4. Anatomy of the authenticated workspace

A logged-in Notion window has three regions. (Sourced from Notion's help center — the authenticated app is gated and was not directly observed in this run; verify against the live UI when you have a session.)

- **Left sidebar** — the workspace tree and navigation hub:
  - Workspace switcher (top) — switch between workspaces you belong to.
  - **Search** (`Cmd/Ctrl+K` or `Cmd/Ctrl+P`) — global search + quick-switcher; the fastest way to jump to any page. Also the AI/ask entry point.
  - **Home** — customizable dashboard (recent pages, upcoming events, etc.).
  - **Inbox** — notifications, mentions, comment replies.
  - **Teamspaces** and **private pages** — collapsible page trees; click the chevron to expand children, `+` to add a sub-page, `•••` for page actions.
  - **Settings** (Settings & members) — account, workspace members, billing, connections, security.
  - **Templates**, **Trash**, and the **invite** control near the bottom.
- **Top bar** — breadcrumb path to the current page, the page's **Share** button, comments, favorite/star, page history, and the `•••` page menu (export, move, duplicate, lock, customize layout).
- **Editor / content area** — the page body. Two archetypes (steps 5a/5b).

### 5. Classify the page you're on, then read its functionality

Use the `snapshot` command (the a11y tree) and inspect the rendered structure. Two archetypes:

**5a. Doc / page (made of blocks).** Everything is a _block_. Typing `/` opens the **slash menu** to insert/transform blocks. Common block types observed on real Notion pages: `heading_1/2/3`, `paragraph` (rich text + inline links), `divider`, `callout` (icon + tinted background), `toggle` (collapsible — a `▶`/Open button that reveals children), `bulleted_list_item`, `image`/`figure` with captions, `link_to_page` (in-page `#anchor` and cross-page links), and inline/embedded `database` blocks. A floating **table of contents** rail may appear on the right. Navigation within a doc = expand toggles, click anchor/page links, scroll.

**5b. Database (a collection with views).** A database is a set of rows (each row is itself a page) plus one or more saved **views**. Recognize it by the **view tabs** (a `tablist`) and the toolbar of controls. Verified controls on a live embedded database: named **view tabs** (e.g. _Table / Board / Calendar / List / Gallery / Timeline_, or custom names), a per-view **count badge**, **Filter**, **Sort**, **Search**, **Edit filters**, and clickable **property column headers** (e.g. Name, Location, URL, Date) that sort/configure that property. Each view type renders the same underlying rows differently (Table = grid, Board = kanban grouped by a property with COUNT rollups, Calendar = by date, Gallery = cards, etc.). Opening a row opens that row's own page (blocks + properties). Navigation within a database = switch view tabs, apply Filter/Sort/Search, open a row.

### 6. Use the help center as the functionality reference

The help center left-nav is effectively a map of every functional area, and each category is a stable deep-link you can fetch for authoritative detail:

- Get started → `/help/category/new-to-notion`, Sidebar navigation → `/help/category/sidebar-navigation`
- Pages & blocks → `/help/category/write-edit-and-customize`
- Databases → `/help/category/databases`; Database views → `/help/category/database-views`
- Sharing & permissions → `/help/category/sharing-and-collaboration`; Notion Sites → `/help/category/notion-sites`
- Automations → `/help/category/automations`; Connections → `/help/category/connections`; Import/export → `/help/category/import-export-and-integrate`
- Notion AI → `/help/category/notion-ai`; Custom Agents → `/help/category/custom-agents`
- Admin → `/help/category/enterprise-admin`; Apps (desktop/web/mobile) → `/help/category/notion-apps`; Mail → `/help/category/notion-mail`; Calendar → `/help/category/notion-calendar`
- Templates → `/help/category/template-gallery`; Plans & billing → `/help/category/plans-billing-and-payment`; Troubleshoot → `/help/category/troubleshooting`; Developer platform → `/help/category/developer-platform`

(Prefix any of the above with `https://www.notion.com`.)

### 7. Session teardown

No session-release step is needed — there is nothing to release. The session persists across calls, keyed by `proxy`/`profile`, so repeat the same `proxy` arg to stay in the same warmed browser with its Cloudflare/login cookies intact; batching the navigation/exploration steps for one surface into a single call's `commands` array just saves round-trips.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **`notion.so` is not the app — it 301-redirects to `notion.com` (marketing).** The app lives at `app.notion.com`; the login page is `app.notion.com/login`. Don't expect a workspace at the bare domain.
- **Almost everything requires login; there is no guest/demo mode.** Without credentials you can only see: the marketing site, the login page, the help center, and public `*.notion.site` pages. Plan tasks accordingly.
- **Public pages hide the authenticated sidebar.** A shared `*.notion.site` page shows a slim top banner (breadcrumb, Search, Share, `•••` More, and a "Get Notion free" CTA) instead of the workspace tree. It is the closest _observable_ analog to the editor, but it is read-only and lacks the slash menu, page actions, and sidebar.
- **Notion scrolls an inner `.notion-scroller` div, not `window`.** `window.scrollTo(...)` is a no-op on `*.notion.site` pages. Scroll the largest `overflow-y` div whose class contains `notion-scroller`, or send PageDown/End keypresses, otherwise screenshots stay pinned to the top of the page.
- **Content hydrates progressively.** After the `goto` (`waitUntil: "load"`), add a `{ "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 3000 } }` before snapshotting — the accessibility tree grew from 420 to 461 refs after the wait on a real page, and databases render their view widget 1–3s after load.
- **The `snapshot` command is the right tool on every Notion surface** (login=42 refs, help=326, public page=461). No HTML scraping needed.
- **A page URL embeds a 32-char UUID after the title slug.** `…/<Page-Title>-<UUID>`. The slug is cosmetic; the UUID is the identity. The same UUID resolves on both `notion.so/<workspace>/<id>` and `<workspace>.notion.site/<id>` (when public).
- **Search/quick-switcher is `Cmd/Ctrl+K` (also `Cmd/Ctrl+P`)** — the single fastest navigation primitive in the authenticated app; prefer it over clicking through the sidebar tree.
- **Every database row is itself a page.** "Opening" a row navigates into a sub-page with its own blocks plus the row's properties — don't mistake it for a modal-only object.
- **The Notion REST API and hosted MCP are not a navigation shortcut.** `api.notion.com/v1` and `mcp.notion.com` require an integration token and are built for data CRUD (create/query pages & databases), not for understanding the rendered UI. They do not satisfy "navigate Notion / understand the functionalities in each page" — use the browser for this skill.
- **Authenticated-app internals were not directly verified in this run** (no account). The workspace-anatomy details in Workflow step 4 come from Notion's own help center; treat them as a strong starting map and confirm against the live UI once logged in. The login wall, marketing redirect, help-center map, and public-page/database UI in steps 2/3/5/6 _were_ directly observed.
