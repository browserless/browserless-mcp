# Beatport Music Search

## Purpose

Search Beatport for electronic-music metadata by a free-text query — either an artist name (`"deadmau5"`) or an artist + track combination (`"eric prydz opus"`) — and return structured results across five entity types: **tracks, artists, releases, labels, and charts**. For each result you get IDs, names, mix names, BPM, musical key, genre, label, release, price, ISRC, artwork URIs, and a canonical Beatport URL. Read-only; never logs in, buys, or downloads.

The recommended path is a lightweight page load, **not** scripted browsing. Beatport is a Next.js app whose search page server-side-renders the complete result set into an embedded `__NEXT_DATA__` JSON blob. A single navigation to the search URL (over a residential proxy) returns every field the rendered page shows — no clicking, no pagination, no interaction. Lead with the goto + extract path; the full browser flow below is a fallback for when you also need screenshots or player interaction.

## When to Use

- Look up a track's metadata (BPM, key, genre, label, release, ISRC, price) from an artist + title string.
- Resolve an artist name to a Beatport `artist_id` and canonical artist URL, plus their genre spread.
- Bulk-enrich a playlist / crate list of "Artist – Title" strings with Beatport IDs and metadata.
- Disambiguate similarly named artists or mixes (the API returns relevance `score` per result).
- Find the release, label, or chart an artist/track belongs to.

## Workflow

### Recommended: load the search page and parse `__NEXT_DATA__`

1. **Build the search URL.** URL-encode the whole query into the `q` param:

   ```
   https://www.beatport.com/search?q=<url-encoded query>
   ```

   For artist + track, just join them with a space: `q=eric%20prydz%20opus`. The single `q` param drives all five result buckets — there is no separate "artist field" vs "track field".

2. **Load over a residential proxy.** Beatport sits behind Cloudflare. The bare homepage (`/`) returns **403** to datacenter IPs, but the `/search` page returns **200** over a residential proxy with a normal browser User-Agent. Call `browserless_agent` with a top-level `proxy: { proxy: "residential" }` (datacenter egress gets Cloudflare-blocked — repeat the `proxy` arg on **every** call, since the session persists across calls keyed by `proxy`/`profile`, and a call that drops or changes the proxy lands in a different session). It navigates and follows redirects natively:

   ```json
   {
     "proxy": { "proxy": "residential" },
     "commands": [
       {
         "method": "goto",
         "params": {
           "url": "https://www.beatport.com/search?q=eric%20prydz%20opus",
           "waitUntil": "load",
           "timeout": 45000
         }
       },
       { "method": "html", "params": { "selector": "html" } }
     ]
   }
   ```

   No auth, no cookies, no full stealth browser session required for this path — the residential proxy alone is sufficient (confirmed across multiple queries). Response is ~150–170 KB of HTML. (You can also fold the extraction in step 3 into an `evaluate` command that reads the `__NEXT_DATA__` script in-page and returns a compact projection under `.value`, avoiding shipping the whole HTML.)

3. **Extract the embedded JSON.** Pull the `__NEXT_DATA__` script tag and walk to the search payload:

   ```js
   const m = html.match(
     /<script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application\/json">([\s\S]*?)<\/script>/,
   );
   const next = JSON.parse(m[1]);
   const data = next.props.pageProps.dehydratedState.queries[0].state.data;
   // data => { tracks, artists, charts, labels, releases }
   ```

   Each bucket is `{ data: [...], ... }`, so the result arrays are `data.tracks.data`, `data.artists.data`, `data.releases.data`, `data.labels.data`, `data.charts.data`. Results are pre-sorted by relevance `score` (descending) — element `[0]` is the best match.

4. **Decode the fields you need** (see Expected Output for full shapes). Key gotchas:
   - **`length` is milliseconds.** `543453` → `543.453 s` → `9:03`. Format as `mm:ss = floor(ms/60000):round((ms%60000)/1000)`.
   - **`genre` is an array** of `{ genre_id, genre_name }` (tracks usually have one; artists list many).
   - **`artists` / `remixers` are arrays** of `{ artist_id, artist_name, artist_type_name }`. Use this to separate the original artist(s) from remixers.
   - **`price` is an object** `{ code, symbol, value, display }` — use `price.display` (`"$1.49"`).
   - **`key_name`** ("A Major"), **`bpm`**, **`isrc`**, **`mix_name`** ("Original Mix") are top-level track fields.
   - **Image URIs** are absolute (`track_image_uri`, `artist_image_uri`); the `*_dynamic_uri` variants contain `{w}x{h}` placeholders you substitute for a custom size.

5. **Build canonical URLs.** The slug segment is cosmetic — Beatport resolves by the trailing numeric ID, so any slug (or a placeholder) works and redirects to the canonical one:
   ```
   Track:   https://www.beatport.com/track/<slug>/<track_id>
   Artist:  https://www.beatport.com/artist/<slug>/<artist_id>
   Release: https://www.beatport.com/release/<slug>/<release_id>
   Label:   https://www.beatport.com/label/<slug>/<label_id>
   Chart:   https://www.beatport.com/chart/<slug>/<chart_id>
   ```

### Browser fallback (only when you need screenshots / player interaction)

The SSR search page is fully JS-hydrated. A live `browserless_agent` session clears Cloudflare with the residential proxy (stealth is built in — no extra flag needed), and the whole flow lives in one `commands` array so the session persists:

1. Call `browserless_agent` with top-level `proxy: { proxy: "residential" }`; datacenter egress hits the Cloudflare interstitial.
2. `{ "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "https://www.beatport.com/search?q=<query>", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } }`.
3. A **cookie-consent dialog** ("Beatport Group Cookie Consent") overlays the page — dismiss it with `{ "method": "click", "params": { "selector": "..." } }` targeting the **`I Accept`** button (confirm the selector via a `{ "method": "snapshot" }` if it misses) before screenshotting.
4. Rather than scraping the rendered DOM, run an `html` command (or an `evaluate` that reads the script tag) and parse the **same `__NEXT_DATA__` blob** described above — the rendered sections (Artists / Releases / Tracks / Charts / Labels) carry no data the JSON doesn't already have.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **Bare homepage 403s; the search page does not.** A pre-run probe of `https://beatport.com/` returned 403 (Cloudflare). Don't conclude the site is unreachable — go straight to `/search?q=…`, which returns 200 over a residential proxy. Never gate your flow on a homepage load.
- **The residential proxy is mandatory.** Both the lightweight goto+extract path and the full live-browser path need `proxy: { proxy: "residential" }` on every `browserless_agent` call (datacenter IPs get Cloudflare-blocked). The extract-only path needs nothing more; the interactive browser path just adds cookie-dialog dismissal and screenshots on top of the same proxied session.
- **The SSR payload is capped at 15 results per bucket.** The embedded query key is `["search-all", { q, count: "15", is_approved: true, preorder: true }, "US"]`. You always get the top ~15 tracks / artists / releases / labels / charts. To go deeper you'd need the authenticated `api.beatport.com/v4` API or the per-type search pages — the public search-all SSR does not paginate.
- **`length` is in milliseconds, not seconds.** Forgetting this turns a 9-minute track into "543,453 seconds". Divide by 1000.
- **Results are scored, not alphabetized.** `state.data.tracks.data[i].score` is the relevance score; `[0]` is the best match. For "artist + track" queries the intended track is reliably `tracks.data[0]`, but verify by matching `artists[].artist_name` + `mix_name` to your input rather than blindly trusting index 0.
- **Geo / locale is baked into the payload.** The query key's trailing element is the storefront locale (`"US"` from a US proxy egress) and `price` is denominated accordingly (`USD`). A proxy egressing elsewhere returns localized pricing/availability.
- **`api.beatport.com/v4/catalog/search/` is OAuth-gated — don't waste time on it unauthenticated.** It returns **HTTP 401** without a bearer token. Confirmed blocked; only useful if you already hold Beatport API credentials.
- **robots.txt disallows AI/crawler UAs (`ClaudeBot`, `GPTBot`, `CCBot`, …) but `Allow: /` for generic `User-agent: *`.** The residential-proxy page load uses a normal browser UA, which is in the allowed bucket; search indexing is explicitly permitted (`Content-Signal: search=yes`). Stay read-only.
- **URL slugs are throwaway.** `https://www.beatport.com/track/anything/15744386` resolves to the canonical track by ID — you never need to know the real slug to build a working link.
- **No site-specific rate limit was hit** across ~5 loads in testing, but Cloudflare fronts everything — keep request volume modest and batch bulk lookups within a single proxied session where you can.

## Expected Output

A normalized object per search. Example for `q="eric prydz opus"`:

```json
{
  "query": "eric prydz opus",
  "locale": "US",
  "result_counts": {
    "tracks": 15,
    "artists": 15,

    "artists": [
      {
        "artist_id": 2863,
        "artist_name": "Eric Prydz",
        "artist_type_name": "Artist"
      }
    ],
    "remixers": [],
    "release": { "release_id": 3517329, "release_name": "Opus" },
    "label": { "label_id": 70017, "label_name": "Virgin Records Ltd" },
    "genre": [{ "genre_id": 96, "genre_name": "Mainstage" }],
    "bpm": 128,
    "key_name": "A Major",
    "length_ms": 543453,
    "length_display": "9:03",
    "isrc": "GB6CM1500105",
    "price": {
      "code": "USD",
      "symbol": "$",
      "value": 1.49,
      "display": "$1.49"
    },
    "publish_date": "2016-02-05T00:00:00",
    "is_explicit": false,
    "track_image_uri": "https://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/1500x250/....png",
    "score": 12345.6,
    "url": "https://www.beatport.com/track/opus/15744386"
  },
  "top_artist": {
    "artist_id": 2863,
    "artist_name": "Eric Prydz",
    "genre": [
      { "genre_id": 15, "genre_name": "Progressive House" },
      { "genre_id": 90, "genre_name": "Melodic House & Techno" }
    ],
    "downloads": 46024,
    "latest_publish_date": "2026-01-28",
    "artist_image_uri": "https://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/590x404/....jpg",
    "score": 189914.77,
    "url": "https://www.beatport.com/artist/eric-prydz/2863"
  }
}
```

Distinct outcome shapes:

- **Track match** (artist + title query) — `tracks.data[0]` is the intended track; populate `top_track` as above.
- **Artist match** (bare artist query) — `artists.data[0]` is the artist; `top_artist` carries the ID, genre spread, and URL. `tracks.data` will also be populated with that artist's most relevant tracks.
- **Multiple/ambiguous matches** — return the full ranked arrays (or top N per bucket) and let the caller disambiguate via `score`, `mix_name`, and `artists[].artist_name`.
- **No results** — every bucket comes back empty (`tracks.data.length === 0`, same for artists/releases/labels/charts). HTTP status is still **200**; detect "not found" by empty arrays, not by status code:

```json
{
  "query": "zzzxqyqwlkjhgfd",
  "locale": "US",
  "result_counts": {
    "tracks": 0,
    "artists": 0,
    "releases": 0,
    "labels": 0,
    "charts": 0
  },
  "top_track": null,
  "top_artist": null
}
```
