# Browse Free Campsites Near a Location

## Purpose

Return the list of campsites and dispersed/free camping spots that freecampsites.net knows about near a given place. For each result you get a structured record — name, listing type, free/fee status, average star rating, review/vote count, distance from the search center, latitude/longitude, the canonical detail-page URL, and a short excerpt. Read-only: this skill only searches and reads listings; it never logs in, adds a site, posts a review, or edits anything.

## When to Use

- "Find free / cheap campsites near {city or area}" or "what dispersed camping is around {place}".
- Building a list of nearby camping options (with coordinates and ratings) for a trip near a US location.
- Any time you'd otherwise scrape the freecampsites.net map UI — the underlying JSON endpoint returns the same data, already structured, in a single request.

## Workflow

freecampsites.net is a Leaflet + AngularJS single-page app on top of WordPress. Its map/search UI is a thin client over a **same-origin JSON endpoint**, so the fastest reliable path is _hybrid_: drive a real browser to the site's origin (so the request carries the right `Referer`, cookies, and an `XMLHttpRequest` header), then call the data endpoint directly from page context and parse JSON. This skips all DOM scraping. A pure server-side HTTP GET does **not** work (see Gotchas).

### Recommended path (hybrid: browser origin + in-page fetch)

Use one `browserless_function` call with a residential proxy. `page.goto` the origin first — so the in-page `fetch` inherits the right `Referer`/cookies and has network egress (a bare `fetch` before navigation has none) — then run the search from page context via `page.evaluate`. The `location` param is a free-form place string; the server geocodes it itself:

```js
export default async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://freecampsites.net/', {
    waitUntil: 'load',
    timeout: 45000,
  });
  // Confirm it loaded: (await page.title()) should be "freecampsites.net". On
  // ERR_HTTP2_PROTOCOL_ERROR / "site can't be reached", retry the call (Gotchas — intermittent).
  return await page.evaluate(async () => {
    const place = 'Bend, Oregon'; // <-- the location to search near
    const u =
      '/wp-content/themes/freecampsites/androidApp.php?location=' +
      encodeURIComponent(place);
    const r = await fetch(u, {
      headers: {
        'X-Requested-With': 'XMLHttpRequest',
        Accept: 'application/json',
      },
    });
    const j = JSON.parse((await r.text()).trim()); // body has leading newlines — trim before parse
    return {
      location: place,
      search_center: { lat: Number(j.latitude), lon: Number(j.longitude) },
      result_count: j.resultList.length,
      campsites: j.resultList.map((s) => ({
        id: s.id,
        name: s.name,
        type: s.type, // "campsite"
        fee: s.type_specific && s.type_specific.fee, // "Free", "Fee", ...
        rating: s.ratings_average, // numeric, e.g. 3.33
        review_votes: s.ratings_count, // integer
        distance_mi: s.distance,
        lat: s.latitude,
        lon: s.longitude,
        city: s.city,
        county: s.county,
        region: s.region,
        country: s.country,
        excerpt: s.excerpt,
        url: s.url, // canonical detail page
      })),
    };
  });
};
```

Emit the returned object. That is the complete result for the location (the endpoint returns the **20 nearest** sites — see Gotchas).

### Browser fallback (pure UI — use only if the endpoint shape changes)

Drive this as one `browserless_agent` call (residential proxy), keeping the steps in a single `commands` array:

1. `{ "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "https://freecampsites.net/", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } }`, then `{ "method": "snapshot" }`.
2. `click` the "Enter a Location" search box, then `{ "method": "type", "params": { "selector": "<box>", "text": "Bend, Oregon" } }` — the `text` param takes the comma literally (no shell-quoting concerns).
3. `snapshot` again, then `click` the matching autocomplete suggestion (e.g. `Bend, Oregon, United States`). The suggestions come from `suggest.php` (a Photon geocoder).
4. `{ "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 3000 } }`, then `snapshot`. The results column on the right populates (~620–660 accessibility refs). Read each listing's name, star rating, distance, and review count from the rendered cards. The per-site detail link is `https://freecampsites.net/#!<id>&query=sitedetails` (or the clean permalink `s.url`).

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **The data endpoint requires a same-origin XHR context.** `GET /wp-content/themes/freecampsites/androidApp.php?location=<place>` returns the full result set **only** when sent with the `X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest` header from the freecampsites.net origin (correct `Referer`/cookies). A raw server-side fetch that never navigates to the origin returns an empty body (just ~20 newline characters, HTTP 200). That is why this skill runs the fetch in-page (`browserless_function` after `page.goto`), not as a bare client call. (A bare HTTP client that sets `X-Requested-With` + `Referer` _might_ work, but this was not verifiable from the build sandbox — treat it as unconfirmed.)
- **`location` is the only param you need.** The server geocodes the free-form `location` string on its own. The `coordinates=` and `advancedSearch={}` params that the UI also sends are optional and had **no effect** on results in testing (passing `coordinates=38.57,-109.55` vs the place name returned identical output). Do not waste time trying to drive the search by raw lat/lon through `coordinates=`.
- **Don't use `?region=`.** An older code path / `?region=<lat,lon>` returns an empty body. Use `?location=<place name>`.
- **Results are capped at the 20 nearest sites.** The response always returned exactly 20 items; no paging/limit parameter was found. To cover a wider area, issue multiple searches at different `location` anchors and de-duplicate by `id`.
- **Ratings are already structured — don't parse the HTML.** Each item has `ratings_average` (float) and `ratings_count` (vote count) as clean fields. The `rating` and `table_row` fields are pre-rendered HTML (star `<img>` tags); ignore them.
- **Fee/free status lives in `type_specific.fee`** ("Free", "Fee", etc.), not at the top level.
- **Response body has leading whitespace.** The JSON is preceded by ~20 newlines and served as `Content-Type: text/html`. Always `.trim()` before `JSON.parse`.
- **Intermittent `ERR_HTTP2_PROTOCOL_ERROR`.** Through Browserbase, freecampsites.net periodically fails to load (Chrome "This site can't be reached", `ERR_HTTP2_PROTOCOL_ERROR` or `ERR_FAILED`) — both on page navigation and on the in-page XHR — especially under repeated/rapid access from one IP. Early in a session it was rock-solid (the search succeeded across multiple sessions); it degraded later. Mitigation: retry the `goto` (and the fetch) a couple of times; a fresh call usually recovers. A residential proxy was used for all successful runs.
- **Autocomplete vs. data call are different endpoints.** `suggest.php?q=<text>&limit=5&bb=<viewport-bbox>` is the Photon geocoder used for the search-box dropdown. You do **not** need it for the data call — `androidApp.php?location=` geocodes by itself.
- **reCAPTCHA exists but is irrelevant here.** It only gates add-a-site / login / review posting (`outbound`, `wdpajax-*` forms). Searching and reading listings never triggers it.
- **`robots.txt` disallows `/outbound`, `*query=routeSearch*`, and `_escaped_fragment_` crawl URLs** — none of which the search-by-location flow touches.
