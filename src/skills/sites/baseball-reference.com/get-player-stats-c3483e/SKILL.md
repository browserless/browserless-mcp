# Baseball-Reference Player Stats

## Purpose

Given a player identifier — a Baseball-Reference URL, a `bbref` player ID (`troutmi01`), a free-form name (`"Mike Trout"`), or a name + disambiguator (`"Frank Thomas, 1990s White Sox"`) — return the canonical player meta block plus the requested stat scope as structured JSON. Scopes cover `standard`, `advanced`, `value`, `pitching`, `fielding`, `appearances`, `postseason`, `salaries`, single-year `game log`, and `batting splits` / `pitching splits` (vs LHP/RHP, home/away, day/night, by month, by count, by pitch type, by leverage, etc.). Read-only — never click Subscribe, Stathead, or any account/mutation control; never submit forms.

## When to Use

- One-off lookups: "What was Mike Trout's 2024 OPS+ and WAR?"
- Career-table extraction for downstream analysis (CSV/JSON pipelines, fantasy tools, sabermetric notebooks).
- Disambiguation of common names ("Frank Thomas" — there are five in MLB history).
- Year-by-year time series, single-season splits, or game-by-game logs.
- Hall of Fame / awards / contract / service-time enrichment alongside stats.
- Two-way players (Ohtani) where both batting and pitching tables are needed in one pass.

## Workflow

Baseball-Reference has **no public JSON API**, but it does have a clean URL contract and predictable HTML structure that makes interactive browsing unnecessary in almost all cases. **Lead with a single `browserless_agent` goto** (`{ "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "...", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } }`) followed by an `html`/`text` grab or an in-page `evaluate` that parses and returns a compact projection. Each player page is a fully-rendered static HTML document; tables expose canonical column keys via `data-stat="<key>"` on every `<td>`, and high-precision sort values via `csk="<float>"`. Some tables are wrapped in `<!-- ... -->` comments to defeat naive scrapers — strip comment markers before parsing, don't try to render them. **No JS-only widgets are involved** for the stat tables this skill targets, and a real browser has **no response-size cap**, so even long-career players load in the same one-call path (see gotcha).

### 1. Resolve the player to a canonical `bbref_id` + URL

Three input shapes, three paths:

**a. URL given:** Parse the bbref ID directly. The canonical shape is `https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/<letter>/<bbref_id>.shtml` where `<letter>` is the first letter of the bbref ID. Reject any other URL shape (e.g., `/register/`, `/minors/`) — those are minor-league pages with a different table schema and are out of scope.

**b. `bbref_id` given (`troutmi01`):** Construct the URL: `https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/{bbref_id[0]}/{bbref_id}.shtml`.

**c. Free-form name (`"Mike Trout"`, `"Frank Thomas, 1990s White Sox"`):** Hit the search endpoint:

```
GET https://www.baseball-reference.com/search/search.fcgi?search=<URL-encoded name>
```

Two possible responses:

- **302 redirect** to a single canonical `/players/<letter>/<id>.shtml` URL → unambiguous. Use that ID directly. A `goto` follows the redirect natively (read `page.url()` in an `evaluate` to capture the resolved bbref ID), so no extra flag is needed.
- **200 HTML** with a `<div id="players" class="current">` block → ambiguous. Inside, every match is a `<div class="search-item">` containing:
  - `<a href="/players/.../*.shtml">Name (YYYY-YYYY)</a>` — bbref URL + active-year range
  - Optional `<span class="search-badge search-hof">Hall of Fame</span>` + `<span class="search-badge search-allstar">All-Star</span>`
  - `<div class="search-item-alt-names">given: <em>Given Name</em>, nickname: <em>Nick</em></div>`
  - `<div class="search-item-team">Franchises: CHW,TOR,OAK</div>`

  **If the caller supplied a disambiguator** (era, team, franchise), filter the list by year-range and/or `search-item-team` text. **If the result is still ambiguous, return the full list verbatim** rather than picking one — surfacing the choice is the correct behavior.

### 2. Fetch the player page

```json
{
  "commands": [
    {
      "method": "goto",
      "params": {
        "url": "https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/<letter>/<id>.shtml",
        "waitUntil": "load",
        "timeout": 45000
      }
    },
    { "method": "html", "params": { "selector": "body" } }
  ]
}
```

The `html` result comes back under `.value`. For players with very long careers (15+ MLB seasons, or two-way players with 20+ combined-discipline rows) the document can top 1 MB — that used to overflow the old fetch ceiling, but a real browser has no such cap, so the same single `goto` + `html` call returns the full markup regardless of length. Because the text return is capped ~200k chars, prefer folding the table extraction into an in-page `evaluate` that returns a compact `JSON.stringify` projection rather than shipping the whole ~1 MB document back for large careers. No separate transport, no session to manage — one call.

### 3. Extract the meta block

`<div id="meta">` contains everything the caller needs about the player. Pull these fields:

| JSON field                | Source pattern                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`                    | `<h1><span>...</span></h1>`                                                                                               |
| `bbref_id`                | derived from URL or `data-soc-sum-entity-id` attribute on tables                                                          |
| `position`                | `<strong>Position:</strong> <text>`                                                                                       |
| `bats`, `throws`          | `<strong>Bats: </strong>Right`, `<strong>Throws: </strong>Right`                                                          |
| `height`, `weight`        | `<p><span>6-1</span>,&nbsp;<span>235lb</span>`                                                                            |
| `current_team`            | `<strong>Team:</strong> <a href="/teams/LAA/2026.shtml">Los Angeles Angels</a>`                                           |
| `date_of_birth`           | `<span id="necro-birth" data-birth="1991-08-07">`                                                                         |
| `birthplace`              | text inside the birth `<span>` after the city link                                                                        |
| `debut_date`              | `<strong><a href="/leagues/majors/{year}-debuts.shtml">Debut:</a></strong> <a ...>July 8, 2011</a>`                       |
| `last_game_date`          | `<strong><a href="/leagues/majors/{year}-lastgame.shtml">Last Game:</a></strong> ...` (present only for retired/inactive) |
| `draft`                   | `<p><strong>Draft</strong>: ...` (free text — preserve verbatim)                                                          |
| `high_school` / `college` | `<strong>High School:</strong>` / `<strong>School:</strong>`                                                              |
| `contract_status`         | `<strong>{YYYY} Contract Status</strong>: ...`                                                                            |
| `service_time`            | `<strong>Service Time (MM/YYYY)</strong>: <years.days>`                                                                   |
| `full_name`               | `<strong>Full Name:</strong> Michael Nelson Trout`                                                                        |
| `nicknames`               | `<strong>Nicknames:</strong> ...`                                                                                         |
| `hall_of_fame`            | check `div#bling` / Hall-of-Fame badge on the page, or look for the `hof_other` table div                                 |
| `mlb_teams`               | enumerate distinct `team_name_abbr` values across the `players_standard_*` table rows, paired with year ranges            |
| `canonical_url`           | `https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/<letter>/<id>.shtml`                                                          |

### 4. Locate the stat table for the requested scope

Every stat table is wrapped in `<div id="all_<table_id>"><div id="div_<table_id>">...<table id="<table_id>">`. The `<table>` element may live **directly in the DOM** or **inside an HTML comment** (`<!-- ... -->`) — same parent `<div id="all_*">` either way. Always strip `<!--` / `-->` before parsing.

Canonical table IDs (as of 2026-05-15):

| Scope                               | Table ID                                                           |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Standard batting (career-by-season) | `players_standard_batting`                                         |
| Advanced batting                    | `players_advanced_batting`                                         |
| Value batting (WAR breakdown)       | `players_value_batting`                                            |
| Standard pitching                   | `players_standard_pitching`                                        |
| Advanced pitching                   | `players_advanced_pitching`                                        |
| Value pitching                      | `players_value_pitching`                                           |
| Standard fielding                   | `players_standard_fielding`                                        |
| Postseason batting (season)         | `players_standard_batting_post`, `players_advanced_batting_post`   |
| Postseason batting (game)           | `players_batting_postseason`                                       |
| Postseason pitching (season)        | `players_standard_pitching_post`, `players_advanced_pitching_post` |
| Postseason pitching (game)          | `players_pitching_postseason`                                      |
| Postseason fielding                 | `players_standard_fielding_post`                                   |
| Appearances by position             | `appearances`, `appearances_post`                                  |
| Salary history                      | `br-salaries`                                                      |
| Last-5-games snapshot               | `last5` (batters), `last5_b` / `last5_p` (two-way)                 |

**Which tables sit in HTML comments depends on the player's primary discipline:**

- **Pure batter** (Trout): batting tables are visible DOM; `appearances`, `br-salaries`, and all `*_postseason` game-level tables are HTML-commented; no pitching tables exist.
- **Pure pitcher** (Verlander): pitching tables are visible DOM; same comment pattern for appearances/salaries/postseason-game.
- **Two-way** (Ohtani): batting tables visible DOM; **all pitching tables HTML-commented**; both `last5_b` and `last5_p` exist.

Don't hardcode "this table is always in a comment" — check `<!--` ancestry per fetch.

### 5. Parse rows

Every row is a `<tr>` with one `<th data-stat="year_id">` and one `<td data-stat="<key>">` per column. Extract columns in document order — bbref preserves a stable, schema-encoded column order per table.

```python
# Pseudocode
soup = BeautifulSoup(html, "html.parser")
# Strip comment markers so commented tables become parseable
for c in soup.find_all(string=lambda t: isinstance(t, Comment)):
    c.replace_with(BeautifulSoup(c, "html.parser"))

table = soup.find("table", id="players_standard_batting")
thead_stats = [th["data-stat"] for th in table.thead.find_all("th") if th.get("data-stat")]
rows = []
for tr in table.tbody.find_all("tr"):
    if "thead" in tr.get("class", []): continue   # mid-table sub-headers
    row = {}
    for cell in tr.find_all(["th", "td"]):
        k = cell.get("data-stat"); if not k: continue
        # Prefer csk (high-precision sort key) when present, fall back to text
        v = cell.get("csk") or cell.get_text(strip=True)
        row[k] = v
    row["_table"] = "players_standard_batting"
    rows.append(row)
```

**Always preserve column order verbatim** — different tables expose different `data-stat` keys; downstream callers need to know the shape. Tag every row with the source `_table` field.

### 6. Year-range filtering, per-game derivation

- Single year: filter rows where `year_id == "2024"`.
- Year range `2018-2024`: filter where year falls in range.
- Career: keep all rows; the final `<tfoot>` row contains career totals (162-game pace, per-PA rates etc. depending on table).
- Per-162 / per-PA: bbref provides per-162 only in the `players_value_*` table (`b_waa_win_perc_162`). For per-game derivations not in the table, the caller must compute from counting + games columns.

### 7. Splits (when requested)

```json
{
  "commands": [
    {
      "method": "goto",
      "params": {
        "url": "https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/split.fcgi?id=<bbref_id>&year=<YYYY>&t=<b|p|f>",
        "waitUntil": "load",
        "timeout": 45000
      }
    },
    { "method": "html", "params": { "selector": "body" } }
  ]
}
```

`t` selects discipline: `b` = batting, `p` = pitching, `f` = fielding. Year is required (career-splits pages exist but use a different schema — out of scope for this skill).

The splits page contains ~25 small tables, one per split dimension. Common table IDs:

- `plato` — vs LHP / vs RHP (platoon)
- `hmvis` — home / away
- `half` — first half / second half
- `month` — by month
- `count` — by count (0-0, 0-1, 1-2, full, ahead, behind, two-strikes, ...)
- `outs` — by outs (0, 1, 2)
- `bases` — by baserunner state
- `clutc` — clutch / late & close / tied-or-close
- `lever` — high / medium / low leverage
- `innng` — by inning
- `times` — by times faced (1st PA / 2nd PA / 3rd PA / 4+)
- `power` — pitch power (fastball, breaking, off-speed velocity bins)
- `gbfb` — by batted-ball type
- `hitlo` — by hit location
- `traj` — by trajectory (GB / LD / FB / PU)
- `oppon` — by opponent team
- `stad` — by stadium
- `site` — by venue (home / away / neutral)

Each row in each split table uses the same `data-stat` schema as the season-level table for that discipline. Tag rows with both `_table` and `_split` (the row's `<th data-stat="split_name">` or equivalent header cell).

### 8. Game log (when requested)

```json
{
  "commands": [
    {
      "method": "goto",
      "params": {
        "url": "https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/gl.fcgi?id=<bbref_id>&year=<YYYY>&t=<b|p|f>",
        "waitUntil": "load",
        "timeout": 45000
      }
    },
    { "method": "html", "params": { "selector": "body" } }
  ]
}
```

Single table per discipline: `players_standard_batting` / `players_standard_pitching` / `players_standard_fielding` (same id namespace as the player page, but the rows are per-game). Year is required.

### 9. Rate-limit and User-Agent

robots.txt enforces `Crawl-delay: 3` — keep ≤ 1 request per 3 seconds sustained, and back off on any 429/503. A `browserless_agent` goto drives a real browser with a normal browser User-Agent; no UA spoofing is needed. **A residential proxy is NOT required** — Cloudflare cache-hits are the dominant response (`Cf-Cache-Status: HIT` on player pages), and the site does not gate per-IP for non-admin paths, so run a plain `browserless_agent` call with no proxy arg.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **READ-ONLY.** Never click Subscribe, Stathead, "Subscribe to Stathead", "Add to Stathead", "Bookmark Player", or any account/share/mutation control. Never submit a form (the only form on player pages is the search box — and we use the GET-side `search.fcgi?search=` URL directly, not the form).
- **Many tables are wrapped in HTML comments.** Baseball-Reference's longstanding anti-naive-scraper measure: `appearances`, `br-salaries`, all `*_postseason` game-level tables, and **the entire non-primary discipline for two-way players** (e.g., Ohtani's pitching tables) live inside `<!-- ... -->` comments. Strip `<!--` / `-->` markers BEFORE feeding the chunk to your HTML parser, or use the parser's comment-traversal API. Cheerio/BeautifulSoup both ignore comment contents by default.
- **Long-career players produce ~1 MB documents — fold extraction into an in-page `evaluate`.** A raw HTTP fetch of the page used to fail at a 1 MB response ceiling for players with ~20+ MLB seasons (verified: Justin Verlander's page is ~1.05 MB). A `browserless_agent` goto drives a real browser with no response-size cap, so the full markup always loads — but the tool's text return is capped ~200k chars, so for large careers do NOT ship the raw `html` back; run an in-page `evaluate` that parses the tables and returns a compact `JSON.stringify` projection. Pure batters typically peak around 900 KB even with 15-season careers; two-way players (Ohtani) sit ~820 KB. **Prefer the in-page-parse path when:** player has ≥ 15 seasons of either discipline, OR player has both batting + pitching tables with ≥ 7 seasons each.
- **`/search/search.fcgi?search=<name>` returns 302 for unambiguous, 200 disambig page for ambiguous.** A single common name like "Frank Thomas" returns 44 search-items; "Mike Trout" 302-redirects directly. Always check status before parsing — a parser expecting a `<div id="meta">` block on a 200-disambig response will silently fail.
- **The `csk` attribute is the high-precision underlying value.** Display text shows `.220`; `csk="0.2195121951"` is the unrounded number. Prefer `csk` over `.get_text()` for any numeric stat the caller intends to use for math.
- **`<strong><em>X</em></strong>` and `<strong>X</strong>` are league-leader markers.** `<strong><em>` = led league; `<strong>` = qualified leader. Strip these wrappers when emitting clean values, or surface them as a `flags: ["led_league"]` / `flags: ["qualified_leader"]` sidecar field.
- **Career-totals row lives in `<tfoot>`, not `<tbody>`.** It has its own `tr` and uses the same `data-stat` schema. Skip it for year-filtered queries; emit it as a `career` row when the caller asked for `year_filter: "career"`.
- **`/players/split.cgi` is robots-disallowed, `/players/split.fcgi` is not.** Same for `gl.fcgi` vs `gl.cgi`. The site's own internal links go to the `.fcgi` variants — use those.
- **Splits + game logs are year-scoped only.** `split.fcgi` and `gl.fcgi` require `year=YYYY`. There is no career-aggregated splits page in the same schema. If a caller asks for career splits, fetch each season's split page and aggregate client-side — or refuse and document the limitation.
- **Two-way players have `last5_b` AND `last5_p`.** Pure batters have `last5`; pure pitchers have `last5`. Branching on the primary table id is wrong — enumerate `div_last5*` IDs and union them.
- **The `players_advanced_*` table includes Statcast-enriched columns when available** (`b_avg_exit_velo`, `b_hard_hit_perc`, `b_ld_perc`, `b_gb_perc`, `b_fb_perc`, `b_pull_perc`, `b_center_perc`, `b_oppo_perc`). These are populated only for 2015-onward seasons (Statcast era). Pre-2015 rows have those columns present but empty — emit `null`, not `""`.
- **`players_value_*` is the WAR-breakdown table** (`b_runs_batting`, `b_runs_baserunning`, `b_runs_double_plays`, `b_runs_fielding`, `b_runs_position`, `b_raa`, `b_waa`, `b_runs_replacement`, `b_rar`, `b_war`, `b_waa_win_perc`, `b_waa_win_perc_162`, `b_war_off`, `b_war_def`, `b_rar_off`). It does NOT contain HR, AVG, OPS, etc. — those live in `players_standard_batting`. Don't conflate them.
- **`team_name_abbr` is a 3-letter Baseball-Reference franchise code, NOT the MLB Statcast/StatsAPI abbreviation.** Examples that differ: `CHW` (bbref) vs `CWS` (MLBAM) for the White Sox; `WSN` (bbref) vs `WSH` for the Nationals; `KCR` vs `KC`; `TBR` vs `TB`. If the caller wants MLBAM-compatible codes, map them post-extraction.
- **Cloudflare caches aggressively (`Cf-Cache-Status: HIT`), so a freshly-updated stat may be stale by minutes.** For in-game / same-day data, expect ≤ 5-minute staleness on counting stats. Card pages (career-totals) update overnight.
- **HOF status appears in two places:** the `hof_other` table div (career voting history) and the `bling` block at top-of-page (badges for HOF, MVP, AS counts, etc.). Use the badge for `hall_of_fame: true|false`; use `hof_other` if the caller wants ballot history (year, votes, percentage).
- **Salary history is partial and US-payroll-only.** `br-salaries` (HTML-commented) starts at the year salary data became public per the BBPA agreement, includes ESCALATORS / OPTIONS columns, and may lag the current season by 1-2 months. Treat absent rows as "not reported," not "$0."
- **Keep resolve → fetch → parse in one `browserless_agent` call.** The browser session persists across separate calls (keyed by the call's `proxy`/`profile` config), so batching is a convenience, not a lifetime rule — chaining the name-search/redirect `goto`, the player-page `goto`, and the extraction `evaluate` into a single `commands` array saves round-trips and avoids accidentally dropping the session config. The bbref ID resolved from a search 302 (read via `page.url()` in an `evaluate`) is then reusable within that same session without a second round-trip.

## Expected Output

The response is a single JSON object with the player meta block, the table rows for the requested scope(s), and any disambig list if the input was ambiguous. Three distinct outcome shapes:

For multi-scope requests (e.g., `standard + advanced + value + splits`), `tables` is an array of one entry per `_table`, each preserving the row-and-column-order schema above. For two-way players, batting tables and pitching tables both appear, each tagged with its own `_table` id. For game-log requests, `tables[].rows` are per-game rather than per-season; the column schema is otherwise identical to the season table.
