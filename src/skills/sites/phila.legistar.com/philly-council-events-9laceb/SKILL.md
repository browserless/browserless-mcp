# Philadelphia City Council Calendar Events

## Purpose

Return a list of Philadelphia City Council meetings and committee hearings published on `phila.legistar.com/Calendar.aspx` — one record per event with the meeting body name, date, time, location, plus stable identifiers (event ID, GUID) and the canonical `MeetingDetail.aspx` URL. Read-only; never books, edits, or submits anything. Output is a Zod-validated array.

## When to Use

- Watching the Philadelphia City Council calendar for new committee hearings or full-council sessions to attend / cover / track.
- Building a date-bounded archive of every meeting the City Council and its committees held in a given year (or "All Years" for the full back-catalog to 2000).
- Filtering by meeting body (CITY COUNCIL, Committee on Finance, joint committees, special committees, etc.) for downstream legislative-tracking pipelines.
- Anywhere you'd otherwise scrape the Legistar HTML grid — the Granicus Legistar Web API (see step 1) is faster, paginated by OData, and structurally cleaner.

## Workflow

phila.legistar.com is a hosted Granicus Legistar instance. **The same data the calendar grid renders is also exposed by the Granicus Legistar Web API at `https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/phila/Events` — no auth, no cookies, no anti-bot, no stealth needed.** Lead with the API path.

> **Transport note (Browserless):** The Legistar Web API is a plain HTTPS OData endpoint — the `GET` examples below are canonical; run them from any HTTP client (`curl`, Node `fetch`, Python `httpx`). Only under restricted egress route via `browserless_function`: navigate the page to the API host first (`page.goto('https://webapi.legistar.com/')`) so a subsequent `page.evaluate` fetch is **same-origin** (which sidesteps the cross-origin CORS block — see the CORS gotcha). Parse/project inside the eval; don't return raw multi-hundred-KB XML.

The browser path works and is the _literal_ task description ("navigate calendar, filter by year") — keep it as the documented fallback for any deployment that can't reach `webapi.legistar.com` at all.

### Recommended — Granicus Legistar Web API

1. **GET the year-bounded slice**:

   ```
   GET https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/phila/Events
       ?$filter=EventDate ge datetime'YYYY-01-01' and EventDate lt datetime'YYYY+1-01-01'
       &$orderby=EventDate desc
       &$top=1000
   ```

   (Spaces in `$filter` must be URL-encoded as `%20` or `+`. Single-quotes must be literal — they're part of OData's `datetime'…'` syntax.) For _all_ years, drop the `$filter`. Returns `application/xml` (`<ArrayOfGranicusEvent>` containing `<GranicusEvent>` children).

2. **Parse XML**. Field map per `<GranicusEvent>`:
   - `EventBodyName` → meeting body / committee name (e.g. `CITY COUNCIL`, `Committee on Finance`, `Joint Committees on …`)
   - `EventDate` → ISO date `YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00` (always midnight; time is in a separate field)
   - `EventTime` → free-text time string (`9:00 AM`, `1:30 PM`, occasionally blank)
   - `EventLocation` → free-text location (`Room 400, City Hall`, sometimes with trailing notes)
   - `EventId` → integer, stable Legistar primary key
   - `EventGuid` → uppercase UUID, stable
   - `EventBodyId` → integer body ID (e.g. `10` = CITY COUNCIL, `39` = Committee of the Whole)
   - `EventInSiteURL` → canonical `MeetingDetail.aspx?LEGID=<id>&GID=30&G=<root-guid>` URL
   - `EventAgendaFile` / `EventMinutesFile` → PDF URLs (nilled with `i:nil="true"` when not published)
   - `EventComment` → notes ("No Calendar for Today", "tabled until …"); often nil

3. **Validate** with the Zod schema below and emit the array.

4. **Paginate** if you set `$top` lower than the year's record count: use `$skip=<n>&$top=<m>` with the same `$filter` + `$orderby`. The 2025 record count is ~154; the API will happily return all of them in a single `$top=1000` call. For "All Years" (≥50k records), `$top` defaults to ~1000 server-side; paginate explicitly.

### Browser fallback — drive `Calendar.aspx`

Use this when the WebAPI is unreachable (proxy / firewall / DNS) or when the consuming environment can't run server-side HTTP and only has a browser session.

1. **Open** `https://phila.legistar.com/Calendar.aspx`. Default view is **"This Month"** with body filter **"City Council and All Committees"**. No stealth required — the site has no anti-bot.

2. **Change the Year filter**. The control is a Telerik RadComboBox at `[id*=lstYears]`. Click the dropdown's "select" link (an anchor inside `cell: select` in the snapshot, adjacent to the year input), wait ~800ms for the option list to render, then click the listitem whose StaticText matches the target — `2025`, `2024`, …, `All Years`, or a relative preset (`This Year`, `Last Year`, `This Month`, `Today`, etc.). This triggers an ASP.NET full-page postback (~2-3s).

3. **Confirm filter applied**. Read `document.querySelector("[id*=lstYears] input[id*=Input]").value` — must equal the year you picked. The page also persists a cookie `Setting-30-Calendar Year=<value>` for subsequent visits in the same session.

4. **Extract page 1** from `table[id*=gridCalendar]`. Filter out pager rows (`tr.querySelectorAll("td").length <= 5`). Data row columns by index:
   - `td[0]` — meeting body name (`CITY COUNCIL`, `Committee on Finance`, …)
   - `td[1]` — meeting date as `M/D/YYYY`
   - `td[2]` — iCalendar export anchor (`a[href*="View.ashx?M=IC"]`)
   - `td[3]` — meeting time `H:MM AM/PM` (occasionally blank)
   - `td[4]` — location, sometimes followed by a `<br>` + emphasized note
   - `td[5]` — Meeting Details anchor → `MeetingDetail.aspx?ID=<EventId>&GUID=<EventGuid>&Options=info|&Search=`
   - `td[6..7]` — Agenda + Accessible Agenda anchors (or "Not available")
   - `td[8..10]` — Agenda Packet, Minutes, Accessible Minutes (often "Not available")

5. **Paginate**. Read `document.body.innerText.match(/Page (\d+) of (\d+)/)` (the string appears twice — once per pager, top + bottom — so dedupe). For pages 2..N, trigger the page postback:

   ```js
   __doPostBack(
     'ctl00$ContentPlaceHolder1$gridCalendar$ctl00$ctl02$ctl00$ctl04',
     '',
   );
   ```

   The control ID encodes the page number in the trailing `ctl04` → page 2, `ctl05` → page 3, etc. Discover the exact ID by selecting the anchor whose `innerText` matches the target page number under `#ctl00_ContentPlaceHolder1_gridCalendar_ctl00NPPHTop`. Wait ~2-3s for postback completion before re-extracting.

6. **Stop** when the pager shows `items A to B of N` with `B === N` or the page number equals the total. Concatenate, dedupe by `EventId` if you ran into the rare pager overlap, validate with Zod, emit.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **Granicus Legistar Web API exists and is unauthenticated** — `https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/phila/Events` is the canonical fast-path. Standard OData (`$filter`, `$orderby`, `$top`, `$skip`, `$select`, `$count`). The `phila` segment is the Legistar client slug; other Legistar cities use the same API shape under their own slug (e.g. `nyc`, `chicago`, `seattle`). **No `phila.legistar.com` cookies or session needed** to hit the API — it's a separate origin.
- **API returns XML only.** `$format=json` is explicitly rejected (`400 — Query option 'Format' is not allowed`). Setting `Accept: application/json` does not switch the response. Parse the XML — every field is a simple `<EventX>value</EventX>` tag, no attributes (except `i:nil="true"` on missing values), so `fast-xml-parser` or a regex strategy both work.
- **API is CORS-blocked from a _cross-origin_ in-browser `fetch()`.** A `fetch("https://webapi.legistar.com/...")` from a page on `phila.legistar.com` (or any other origin) fails with `TypeError: Failed to fetch`. Call it from a plain HTTP client (Node `fetch`, `curl`, Python `httpx`), or — inside `browserless_function` — navigate the page directly to the `webapi.legistar.com` origin first so the follow-up `page.evaluate` fetch is **same-origin** and not subject to CORS.
- **`EventDate` is always midnight (`T00:00:00`).** The wall-clock time is a separate string in `EventTime` (`"9:00 AM"`, `"1:30 PM"`, occasionally blank or `"TBD"`). Combine them client-side if you need a full datetime; don't trust `EventDate`'s time component.
- **`EventTime` is free-text, not parseable as a fixed format.** Most values are `H:MM AM/PM`. Some events have `EventTime` blank (especially older records and "No Calendar for Today" placeholders). The grid also shows blank time for the same events.
- **HTML date format is `M/D/YYYY`, not `MM/DD/YYYY`.** No zero-padding (`5/4/2026` not `05/04/2026`). Parse defensively.
- **The calendar grid defaults to "This Month" + "All committees".** A fresh `GET /Calendar.aspx` returns ~18 rows (the current month). The Year dropdown must be set explicitly to pull a full year. The body dropdown defaults to "City Council and All Committees" which is _all_ events; narrowing to "CITY COUNCIL" alone filters out committee meetings.
- **ASP.NET WebForms postbacks, not URL-driven filters.** Year, body, search, sort, and pagination all go through `__doPostBack(...)` with `__VIEWSTATE` cookies — there is no `?year=2025` URL param. You can't deep-link to a filtered view; cookies persist filter state but only across requests in the same session (`Setting-30-Calendar Year=2025`, `Setting-30-Calendar Body=All`, `Setting-30-ASP.calendar_aspx.gridCalendar.SortExpression=MeetingStartDate DESC`).
- **Telerik RadComboBox quirks.** The Year and Body dropdowns are not native `<select>` elements. Open them by clicking the small "select" anchor adjacent to the textbox (cell role `select`, ref like `[1-381]` in the a11y tree). Options render in a floating div outside the table cell. `<select name=…>` selectors do not work.
- **Pagination chunk is 100 rows.** Pager text `Page X of Y, items A to B of N` appears _twice_ (top + bottom pager) — the regex matches both; dedupe before parsing. Total record count is the `N` at the end. Pages > 1 are reached via `__doPostBack("ctl00$ContentPlaceHolder1$gridCalendar$ctl00$ctl02$ctl00$ctl<NN>", "")` where `<NN>` encodes the page number — discover the literal control ID by querying the pager anchors rather than guessing.
- **"All Years" returns the full back-catalog (~50,000 events from 2000 onward).** Don't accidentally pick it for a single-year extraction — both the browser path (500 pages) and the API path (50k records over N $skip pages) get expensive. Always pass an explicit year filter unless you actually want everything.
- **"Joint Committees" event names are long.** Examples: "Joint Committees on Public Health & Human Services and Public Safety", "Joint Special Committee on Gun Violence Prevention & Committee on Children and Youth". Display-width truncation in the rendered table is a CSS concern only — the underlying `EventBodyName` (API) or `td[0].innerText` (browser) contains the full string.
- **`EventBodyName` is the authoritative meeting-body field.** The browser path renders the same string into `td[0]`; both are consistent. Do not derive body from `EventBodyId` — body IDs are stable but not human-readable.
- **Location cell has trailing emphasis notes.** For CITY COUNCIL rows, `td[4]` reads `Room 400, City Hall` followed by `<br>` + an italicized "_PLEASE USE THE AGENDA PDF to select an item for PUBLIC COMMENT, not the MEETING DETAILS._" When extracting a clean location, take the first line of the innerText only. Budget hearings on Committee of the Whole append `_BUDGET_` similarly.
- **No anti-bot / no stealth.** The site is bare ASP.NET WebForms on Microsoft-IIS/10.0 served via Granicus. A residential `proxy` on the `browserless_agent` fallback is _not_ required — it costs extra and offers no benefit. Default to a plain `browserless_agent` call (no `proxy` arg).
- **iCalendar export per event.** Each row has an `View.ashx?M=IC&ID=<EventId>&GUID=<EventGuid>` link that returns a standalone `.ics` file. Useful as a stable per-event permalink alongside `MeetingDetail.aspx`.

  date: z.string().regex(/^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$/),
  time: z.string(), // may be empty for "No Calendar" placeholders
  body: z.string().min(1), // same as name in this dataset, kept distinct for downstream filters
  location: z.string(),
  eventId: z.number().int().positive(),
  eventGuid: z
    .string()
    .regex(/^[0-9A-F]{8}-[0-9A-F]{4}-[0-9A-F]{4}-[0-9A-F]{4}-[0-9A-F]{12}$/),
  meetingDetailUrl: z.string().url(),
