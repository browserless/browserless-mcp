    rationale: >-
      Browser is the recommended method only in the sense that 'open the URL and
      verify the 404 / 302 to confirm the deprecation is still in effect' is the
      most defensible path. There is no live page to scrape. The skill returns a
      structured `tsa_web_tool_deprecated` outcome with pointers to (a) the
      MyTSA iOS/Android app (not browseable) and (b) third-party trackers like
      flyindex.org / tsatracker.com (not TSA-published).

# TSA Check Wait Time

## Purpose

Given a US airport (IATA code or name) and optionally a checkpoint / terminal and a day-of-week + hour-of-day window, return the current and historical TSA security-line wait times. **TSA does not currently publish this data on the public web.** This skill documents that gap, the dead-ends future agents should not re-walk, and the only viable fallback paths (MyTSA mobile app — not browseable — and third-party scrapers / crowd-sourced trackers). Read-only.

## When to Use

- A user asks "how busy is SFO Terminal 3 on a Friday at 6am?" or "what's the current wait at ATL checkpoint A?"
- A travel-planning agent wants to recommend an arrival-time buffer for a specific airport + day-of-week + hour.
- Any flow that _would_ call a TSA wait-time API if one existed — so the agent fails fast with a clear "deprecated, here are the alternatives" answer instead of looping on 404s.

## Workflow

**Bottom line up front: there is no public TSA web endpoint that returns current or historical per-airport per-checkpoint wait times as of 2026-05-18.** The legacy MyTSA web tool was retired (`apps.tsa.dhs.gov/mytsa/wait_times_home.aspx` has 302-redirected to `https://www.tsa.gov/mobile` since at least Nov 2023, verified via Wayback Machine capture `20231116141524`). The path implied by the user prompt — `https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/times` — returns HTTP 404 with TSA's standard "Page Not Found" Drupal template. Same for every plausible variant (`/wait-times`, `/security-screening/wait-times`, `/security-screening/checkpoint-wait-times`).

Given that constraint, the workflow is:

1. **Recognize the dead end fast.** If asked for TSA wait times, **do not** issue browser requests to `tsa.gov` looking for a wait-times widget — none exists. Issuing them just produces 404s and wastes tokens. Skip directly to step 2.

2. **Pick a fallback path based on intent.** TSA's wait-time data only lives in two places today:

   | Caller intent                                                              | Best surface                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Browseable?                                                                                                                                                          |
   | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | "What's the historical pattern at SFO T3 on Fri 6am?" (the user's example) | **MyTSA iOS/Android app** — retains the "Check how busy the airport is likely to be on your specific day and time of travel based on historical data" feature per `https://www.tsa.gov/mobile`                                                                                        | **No** — native app only, no public REST/JSON endpoint, no web mirror                                                                                                |
   | "What's the live wait at ATL right now?"                                   | **Third-party crowdsourced trackers** (`tsatracker.com`, `flyindex.org/airports/{iata}/tsa-wait-times/`, `flightcheck.live/tsa-wait-times`). These re-derive wait times from a mix of user reports, airline data, and historical TSA throughput stats. **They are NOT TSA-published** | Yes — each has its own SKILL surface; a future agent should produce per-site skills (e.g. `tsatracker.com/check-wait-time`) rather than treating them as a TSA proxy |
   | "How many people did TSA screen yesterday nationwide?"                     | `https://www.tsa.gov/travel/passenger-volumes` — daily total nationwide checkpoint count, table with two columns: `Date`, `Numbers` (e.g. `5/17/2026 → 2,887,942`). Updated Mon–Fri by 9am ET                                                                                         | Yes (200, plain HTML table) — but it answers a _different_ question than the prompt                                                                                  |

3. **Return a `not_supported` outcome with the explanation.** The honest contract is to fail with structured information so the calling agent can route the user appropriately rather than hallucinate numbers.

### If the caller insists on a TSA-published answer

Direct them to `https://www.tsa.gov/mobile` and the MyTSA App on iTunes (`itunes.apple.com/us/app/mytsa/id380200364`) or Google Play (`play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gov.dhs.tsa.mytsa`). Then return `{ "success": false, "reason": "tsa_web_tool_deprecated", "fallback": "mytsa_mobile_app" }`.

### If the caller will accept third-party data

The two highest-coverage third-party endpoints (live as of 2026-05-18, surfaced via `browserless_search`) are:

- `https://flyindex.org/airports/{iata-lowercase}/tsa-wait-times/` — per-airport page with both current estimate and historical hourly heatmap. Covers all major US airports (`atl`, `dfw`, `den`, `ord`, `lax`, `jfk`, `sfo`, `sea`, `clt`, `mia`, `phx`, `iah`, `bos`, `ewr`, `lga`, `dca`, `mco`, …). Each page is fully server-rendered HTML — extractable via a `browserless_agent` `goto` + `evaluate` (or a plain HTTPS GET), no proxy needed. Anti-bot: none observed.
- `https://tsatracker.com/airports/{iata-lowercase}-tsa-wait-times` — same shape, slightly different historical-window UI.

Build a separate per-domain skill for whichever third-party you choose; **do not put third-party scraping under `tsa.gov/` in the catalog** — the data is not TSA's.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **The canonical URL in the user prompt 404s.** `https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/times` returns HTTP 404 with `<title>Page Not Found | Transportation Security Administration</title>`. Confirmed 2026-05-18 via an HTTP status probe (a `browserless_function` that `goto`s the URL and reads the response status, or a plain HTTPS HEAD/GET). This is not a transient block — TSA's CMS does not have a node at that path.
- **Every other plausible TSA wait-time URL is also dead.** Tested 2026-05-18: `/wait-times` (404), `/travel/security-screening/wait-times` (404), `/travel/security-screening/checkpoint-wait-times` (404), `apps.tsa.dhs.gov/mytsa/wait_times_home.aspx` (302 → `/mobile`), `apps.tsa.dhs.gov/mytsa/airport_details.aspx?ap=ATL` (302 → `/mobile`), `apps.tsa.dhs.gov/MyTSAWebService/GetTSOWaitTimes.ashx?ap=ATL&output=json` (302 → `http://www.tsa.gov`). Don't waste turns probing more variants — TSA actively redirects the entire legacy app surface to a static "use the mobile app" landing.
- **The deprecation is old.** Wayback Machine capture `20231116141524` already shows the same 302 → `/mobile` redirect, so the web tool has been gone for >2 years. There is no realistic chance it returns; treat the dead end as permanent.
- **MyTSA mobile app is not browseable.** The `/mobile` page only advertises the native iOS/Android download. The app's airport-busy data is fetched over a proprietary internal endpoint that is not documented and is gated by mobile-app cert pinning + user-agent checks — out of scope for a browser-driving agent.
- **`/travel/passenger-volumes` is NOT a substitute.** It returns one row per _day_ with a single nationwide total (column header `Numbers`, e.g. `2,887,942`). No airport, no checkpoint, no hour, no wait-time minutes. If a caller asks for SFO Friday 6am, this dataset cannot answer.
- **Third-party trackers (`tsatracker.com`, `flyindex.org`, `flightcheck.live`) are NOT TSA-published.** They derive estimates from user reports, airline data, and historical TSA throughput stats. Their numbers may correlate with reality but should never be labeled "TSA reported wait time" — call them "third-party estimate, source: {site}". Build a per-domain skill if you want this data; do not silently substitute for TSA.
- **The DHS-owned `https://www.dhs.gov/check-wait-times` page** (a top search result for "TSA wait times") is a hub page that links to CBP border-crossing wait times and airport-arrival CBP processing — **not TSA security checkpoint** waits. Do not confuse these; they are different agencies and different datasets.
- **The TSA news/blog tag `https://www.tsa.gov/blog/tags/wait-times`** returns press releases ("TSA prepared for busy travel season"), not data. Skip it.
- **An HTTP status probe is sufficient here — no full browser render needed.** Every candidate URL is 404/302 at the HTTP layer, so there is no JS-rendered SPA element to wait for; confirming the deprecation only requires reading the response status, not driving a live page. Use a `browserless_function` HTTP probe (`goto` the URL, read the response status) or a plain HTTPS HEAD/GET. Future regeneration attempts should re-run that same status-probe pattern before assuming a live tool exists — spinning up a full `browserless_agent` browser session buys nothing when the URLs are dead at the HTTP layer.

## Expected Output

Three distinct outcome shapes. The first is what this skill produces today. The other two are forward-looking — if TSA restores the tool, or if the caller opts into third-party data and the agent has access to a separate per-domain skill.

  },
  "source": "tsa.gov"
}
```

### Outcome 3 — `success_third_party` (if caller opts into third-party data and a per-site skill is invoked)

```json

}
```
