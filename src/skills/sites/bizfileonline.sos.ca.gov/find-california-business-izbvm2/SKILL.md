# Find a California Business (SOS bizfile Online)

## Purpose

Look up a registered business entity (Corporation, LLC, LP, or Nonprofit) in the
California Secretary of State **bizfile Online** registry by name or entity
number, and return its public registration details: entity name, entity number,
status, initial filing/registration date, entity type, jurisdiction, and agent
for service of process. This is a **read-only** lookup against public records —
no login, filing, or payment is involved.

> ⚠️ **Reliability caveat (read first):** The search endpoint is gated by
> **Imperva Advanced Bot Protection (ABP)**. During testing, the static page and
> all metadata GET endpoints loaded fine, but the actual search request
> (`POST /api/Records/businesssearch`) returned an **empty-body HTTP 403 on every
> attempt** from an automated cloud browser — across plain, residential-proxy
> (`proxy: { proxy: "residential" }`), and captcha-`solve` `browserless_agent`
> configurations, in fresh un-throttled sessions, via both the app's own XHR and
> a direct in-page `fetch`. Treat reliable automated search from a datacenter /
> headless-detected browser as **not currently achievable**. See Site-Specific
> Gotchas for the full picture and the exact API contract for environments that
> can pass ABP (a genuine residential browser session).

## When to Use

- A user asks whether a specific company is registered in California and wants its
  entity number, status (Active / Suspended / FTB Forfeited / Dissolved /
  Cancelled), or initial filing date.
- You need the agent for service of process or jurisdiction (e.g. Delaware vs.
  California) of a California-registered entity.
- You want to confirm a proposed business name is distinguishable / already taken.
- You are reading public corporate metadata to feed a downstream task (due
  diligence, KYB, name availability).

Do **not** use this for Limited Liability Partnerships (LLPs) or General
Partnerships (GPs) — those are not in this search index (see gotchas).

## Workflow

The realistic working path is the **browser UI** — the underlying JSON API
requires an in-session Imperva token and cannot be called standalone (see
gotchas). Lead with the browser, but know it is blocked by ABP from
bot-detected browsers.

1. **Open the search page**
   `https://bizfileonline.sos.ca.gov/search/business`
   It is a React SPA served behind Imperva. Wait ~8–12 s after navigation so the
   Imperva JS challenge runs and sets the `reese84` cookie (also mirrored into
   `localStorage.reese84`). Confirm the title is
   `Search | California Secretary of State`.

2. **Locate the search controls** via an accessibility snapshot:
   - textbox **"Search by name or file number"** (the only text input on the page)
   - button **"Execute search"** (magnifier icon, immediately to its right)
   - button **"Advanced"** (opens entity-type / status / filing-date-range filters)

3. **Enter the query.** Fill the textbox with the company name (e.g. `Tesla`) or
   the entity number **with the leading "C" removed** (e.g. `0806592` not
   `C0806592`). The search is a "keyword" / contains match and returns up to the
   **500 closest matches**.
   - Set the value with a `type` command, e.g.
     `{ "method": "type", "params": { "selector": "input[type=text]", "text": "Tesla" } }`
     (confirm the selector via `snapshot` if it misses). Passing the text as a JSON
     `text` param sidesteps the shell-quoting hazard the old CLI had with names
     containing commas/periods (e.g. `Tesla, Inc.`). Typing correctly drives React
     state (the "Please provide valid search criteria" hint clears once the value
     registers).

4. **Submit.** Click the "Execute search" button (or press Enter in the textbox).
   This fires `POST /api/Records/businesssearch` (see contract in gotchas).

5. **Read the results.** On success the SPA renders a results table; click a row
   to open the right-hand **detail drawer** with the entity's full record
   (number, status, dates, jurisdiction, agent). Extract the best-matching active
   entity into the Expected Output shape.

6. **If the results never appear** (table stays empty, or a transient _"An error
   has occurred. Please try your search again"_ toast shows): the search XHR was
   blocked by Imperva ABP (HTTP 403). This is the expected failure mode from a
   bot-detected browser — there is no client-side retry that fixes it. Report
   `success: false` with `error_reasoning` describing the ABP block.

### Underlying JSON API (for environments that pass ABP)

If your browser session is _not_ flagged by Imperva (a real residential Chrome
profile, or a Browserbase session that has somehow cleared ABP), the SPA's own
mechanism is a single POST you can replay **within the same session** (it relies
on the session's `reese84` Imperva cookie — it is **not** callable from a bare
curl/fetch outside a challenged browser):

```
POST https://bizfileonline.sos.ca.gov/api/Records/businesssearch
Content-Type: application/json
(cookies: reese84, incap_ses_* from the loaded page)

{
  "SEARCH_VALUE": "Tesla",          // query: name, or entity # without leading "C"
  "SEARCH_FILTER_TYPE_ID": "0",      // 0 = keyword/contains (default)
  "SEARCH_TYPE_ID": "1",             // entity-class selector (1 = default set)
  "FILING_TYPE_ID": "",              // entity-type filter (empty = all); from Advanced
  "STATUS_ID": "",                   // status filter (empty = all); from Advanced
  "FILING_DATE": { "start": null, "end": null },  // initial-filing date range
  "CORPORATION_BANKRUPTCY_YN": false,
  "CORPORATION_LEGAL_PROCEEDINGS_YN": false,
  "OFFICER_OBJECT": { "FIRST_NAME": "", "MIDDLE_NAME": "", "LAST_NAME": "" },
  "NUMBER_OF_FEMALE_DIRECTORS": "99",
  "NUMBER_OF_UNDERREPRESENTED_DIRECTORS": "99",
  "COMPENSATION_FROM": "", "COMPENSATION_TO": "",
  "SHARES_YN": false, "OPTIONS_YN": false, "BANKRUPTCY_YN": false,
  "FRAUD_YN": false, "LOANS_YN": false, "AUDITOR_NAME": ""
}
```

The advanced fields (`OFFICER_OBJECT`, director counts, compensation, shares,
etc.) belong to the **Publicly Traded Disclosure** search and can be left at the
defaults above for an ordinary name lookup.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **Imperva ABP blocks the search POST — confirmed, not a transient.** The 403 is
  served with `x-cdn: Imperva`, `x-iinfo: ... NNNN`, ASP.NET headers, and a
  **zero-length body** — the classic ABP "silent block" signature. It reproduced
  on every one of 4+ fresh sessions and all stealth combinations
  (plain, residential proxy, both, plus a `solve` attempt). There is **no
  visible CAPTCHA** to solve, so `solve` does nothing here. Don't
  waste iterations toggling stealth flags — the block is keyed on the browser's
  TLS/behavioral fingerprint, not on cookies or proxies.
- **The block is endpoint-specific.** The HTML page, `/ixt-...` Imperva sensor,
  and the metadata GETs (`/api/Auth`, `/api/AppSetting/*`, `/api/GroupItems/COUNTRY`,
  `/api/search/description/business`) all return **200** in the same session. Only
  the sensitive `POST /api/Records/businesssearch` is 403'd. Hammering it quickly
  escalates the session to a broader block (subsequent GETs started returning 500).
- **403 comes from behind Imperva, styled as ASP.NET.** Don't be fooled by the
  `Server: Microsoft-IIS/10.0` / `x-aspnet-version` headers into thinking it's an
  application auth error you can fix with a token — the empty body + `x-iinfo`
  marker is ABP. A genuine missing-auth would be 401 with a body.
- **No anonymous bearer token exists.** `/api/Auth` returns `false` for guests,
  there is no token in `localStorage`/`sessionStorage` (only `reese84` +
  `OKTA_CONFIG`), and the app legitimately sends `Authorization: undefined` for
  anonymous search. So the API is _meant_ to work without auth — it's purely the
  ABP layer that rejects automated clients. Don't go hunting for an Okta token;
  the Okta config is only for the logged-in filing flow.
- **The API is not replayable standalone.** Because it depends on the in-session
  `reese84` Imperva cookie (and that cookie is bound to the challenged browser's
  fingerprint), you cannot lift the request into a separate `curl`/`fetch`. It
  only ever works _inside_ a browser session that Imperva trusts.
- **Entity-number searches: drop the leading "C".** The UI tip says search by
  number with the "C" removed (e.g. `0806592`, not `C0806592`).
- **Pass the search value as a `type` command `text` param.** Company names
  contain commas and periods (`Tesla, Inc.`); handing them to the `type` command's
  JSON `text` field sidesteps the shell-quoting hazard the old CLI had entirely —
  no selector-vs-ref distinction needed.
- **Results cap at 500 closest matches.** Use the Advanced panel (entity type /
  status / initial-filing-date range, "Begins with" filter) to narrow broad
  queries; there's an option to view more than the 500 default.
- **Out of scope:** LLPs and GPs are **not** in this search. For those, the site
  directs users to a paper Business Entity Records Order Form.
- **Results render in a portal/drawer.** A successful result set populates a table
  and a right-hand detail drawer (React portals) — re-snapshot after the search
  resolves rather than reading the pre-search accessibility tree.

## Expected Output

Normalized shape the skill should return. **Note:** because the search POST was
blocked by Imperva ABP in every test, a live 200 response was never captured —
the field values below are **illustrative** of the record shape the UI exposes,
not observed data.

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "query": "Tesla",
  "result_count": 1,
  "results": [
    {
      "entity_name": "TESLA, INC.",
      "entity_number": "C0806592",
      "status": "Active",
      "entity_type": "Corporation",
      "registration_date": "2003-07-01",
      "jurisdiction": "DELAWARE",
      "agent": "C T CORPORATION SYSTEM"
    }
  ],
  "error_reasoning": null
}
```

Anti-bot block (the outcome actually observed during testing — the search XHR
returns HTTP 403 with an empty body and no results render):

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "query": "Tesla",
  "result_count": 0,
  "results": [],
  "error_reasoning": "Search blocked by Imperva Advanced Bot Protection: POST /api/Records/businesssearch returned HTTP 403 with an empty body (x-cdn: Imperva, x-iinfo NNNN). Reproduced across verified/proxies/solve-captchas session configs. The page HTML and metadata GET endpoints load, but the search request is rejected for bot-detected browsers."
}
```

No matches found (expected shape when ABP is passed but the query has no hits):

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "query": "Zzz No Such Entity Llc",
  "result_count": 0,
  "results": [],
  "error_reasoning": null
}
```
