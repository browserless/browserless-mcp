# FotMob Match & Player Stats

## Purpose

Given a free-text query (team / fixture / player name), find a specific football match on FotMob and return:

- **Team match stats** — possession, expected goals (xG), shots, passes, defence, duels, discipline, etc., as home/away pairs.
- **Per-player match stats** — every player's rating, minutes, goals/assists, passing, duels, physical metrics, plus shotmap, for that single match.
- **Player general stats** — a player's current-season league summary and full per-season/per-competition breakdown, recent matches, career history, traits and bio.

Read-only. Never follows, subscribes, or posts. The fast path uses FotMob's public search API and server-rendered page data (no auth, no anti-bot); a browser fallback covers the minority of match pages that defer their data to a client-side, token-signed request.

## When to Use

- "What were the match stats for {home} vs {away}?" — possession, xG, shots, cards.
- "How did {player} play in {match}?" — single-match player rating and stat line.
- "Give me {player}'s season numbers" — appearances, goals, assists, rating per competition.
- Bulk/automated harvesting of match or player statistics where you'd otherwise scrape FotMob HTML.

## Workflow

FotMob serves no anti-bot challenge on these surfaces — a plain `browserless_agent` load (no proxy, no stealth) works. The recommended path is **hybrid**: pull search results and player data cheaply, and pull match stats from the match page's embedded JSON, dropping to a full browser render only when a given match page ships an empty shell.

**Transport for the JSON/HTML reads below:** the search API is CORS-open and the pages are server-rendered. Run the JSON GET through `browserless_function` — `page.goto("https://apigw.fotmob.com/")` first (a bare in-page `fetch` has no network egress until you navigate), then `page.evaluate(async () => (await fetch("/searchapi/suggest?...")).json())`. For the HTML surfaces, drive `browserless_agent` (`goto` + read `__NEXT_DATA__` via `text`/`evaluate`).

### Step 1 — Find the match (and player IDs) via the search API

```
GET https://apigw.fotmob.com/searchapi/suggest?term=<url-encoded query>&lang=en
```

Returns JSON (no headers/auth needed; CORS-open). Read:

- `matchSuggest[].options[].payload` → `id` (the numeric **matchId**), `homeName`, `awayName`, `leagueName`, `leagueId`, `matchDate`, `homeScore`, `awayScore`, `statusId`.
- `teamSuggest[].options[].payload` → team `id` + `name`.
- `squadMemberSuggest[].options[].payload` → player `id` + `name` + `teamName` (use this to resolve a player by name).

Pick the matchId you want. A two-word `term` (e.g. `arsenal paris`) narrows multi-fixture rivalries; a bare team name returns that team's recent/upcoming matches.

### Step 2 — Get match stats + per-player match stats from the match page

Resolve the canonical URL — `https://www.fotmob.com/match/<matchId>` issues a **308** redirect whose `Location` is `https://www.fotmob.com/matches/<slug>/<code>`. Fetch that canonical URL and parse the `<script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">` blob:

- **Match metadata**: `props.pageProps.general` → `matchId`, `matchName`, `leagueName`, `homeTeam`, `awayTeam`, `finished`, `matchTimeUTC`.
- **Team match stats**: `props.pageProps.content.stats.Periods.All.stats[]` — an array of groups (`Top stats`, `Shots`, `Expected goals (xG)`, `Physical performance`, `Passes`, `Defence`, `Duels`, `Discipline`). Each group has `stats[]`, and each entry is `{ title, key, stats: [home, away], format, type }`. (`Periods` also has `FirstHalf`, `SecondHalf`, `FirstExtraHalf`, `SecondExtraHalf`.)
- **Per-player match stats**: `props.pageProps.content.playerStats` is an **object keyed by playerId**. Each value is `{ name, id, optaId, teamId, teamName, isGoalkeeper, shirtNumber, usualPosition, stats: [groups...], shotmap: [...] }`. Each stat group's `stats` is an object keyed by label → `{ key, stat: { value, total?, type } }` (e.g. `Top stats → "FotMob rating" → {value: 7.26}`, `"Accurate passes" → {value: 88, total: 95}`). **Players who did not play have `stats: []`** — skip them.
- Also available: `content.lineup`, `content.shotmap`, `content.momentum`, `content.h2h`, `content.matchFacts`.

**Pre-render caveat (important):** match `__NEXT_DATA__` carries `content` only for **pre-rendered** matches (popular/recent fixtures). For deferred matches the blob is just `{ fetchingLeagueData: true, fallback: {...}, translations: {...} }` with **no `general`/`content`** — the app loads the data client-side. Detect this (missing `props.pageProps.content`) and switch to the **Browser fallback** below.

### Step 3 — Get the player's general (season/career) stats from the player page

```
GET https://www.fotmob.com/players/<playerId>
```

Always server-rendered (200, no redirect). Parse `__NEXT_DATA__` `props.pageProps.data`:

- `mainLeague` → `{ leagueId, leagueName, season, stats: [{ title, value }] }` — current-season summary (Matches, Started, Goals, Assists, Minutes played, Rating, cards).
- `statSeasons[]` → per season, `tournaments[]` with `{ name, tournamentId, entryId, hasDeepStats }`.
- `playerInformation[]` → height, shirt, age, preferred foot, country, market value.
- `primaryTeam`, `recentMatches[]` (each carries that match's `matchId`, `minutesPlayed`, `goals`, `assists`, `rating`), `careerHistory`, `trophies`, `marketValues`, `traits`.

`recentMatches[]` is a handy shortcut: a player's recent single-match stat lines are already on the player page, so you can often skip Step 2 when you only need a player's line for a recent match.

### Browser fallback (universal — required for deferred match pages)

When a match page's `__NEXT_DATA__` has no `content`, render it with one `browserless_agent` call (no proxy/stealth needed) — keep the whole flow in a single `commands` array so the hydrated session persists:

```json
{
  "commands": [
    {
      "method": "goto",
      "params": {
        "url": "https://www.fotmob.com/match/<matchId>",
        "waitUntil": "load",
        "timeout": 45000
      }
    },
    { "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 3000 } },
    { "method": "text", "params": { "selector": "body" } }
  ]
}
```

- The `goto` follows the `/match/<id>` → `/matches/<slug>/<code>` redirect; the `waitForTimeout` lets the app issue the `matchDetails` XHR (with its client-generated `x-mas` header) and hydrate.
- The body `text` reliably contains the full stat tables (possession, xG, shots…) and the per-player ratings table for both teams, regardless of pre-render state. Parse the labelled values from it. (You can also read `{ "method": "text", "params": { "selector": "script#__NEXT_DATA__" } }`, which may now be populated.)
- For the player page, the same `goto` + body `text` on `https://www.fotmob.com/players/<id>` works, but Step 3's plain read is normally sufficient.

Do **not** use `snapshot`/`click` to read stats — FotMob is heavily JS-driven and the a11y snapshot returns empty/error. Navigate by URL and read body text or `__NEXT_DATA__`.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **No anti-bot on these surfaces.** A plain `browserless_agent` load and `browserless_function` reads both succeed; the pre-run probe and live runs needed neither stealth nor a proxy. Don't add them — they only slow it down.
- **`apigw.fotmob.com/matchDetails` and `/playerData` are a dead end without the `x-mas` header.** Both return **404** when called directly (the token is generated by FotMob's obfuscated client JS per request). Confirmed across multiple attempts. Use page-embedded `__NEXT_DATA__` (or the rendered body in a browser, which generates `x-mas` for you) instead — do not waste time trying to forge `x-mas`.
- **Old `www.fotmob.com/api/...` paths are gone.** `www.fotmob.com/api/matches`, `/api/searchapi/...` etc. now 404 (handled by the Next.js app, not the API). The live API host is `apigw.fotmob.com`; only `searchapi/suggest` (and `searchapi/search`) are usable unauthenticated.
- **Match `__NEXT_DATA__` is populated only for pre-rendered matches.** Verified live: the CL final (`/matches/arsenal-vs-paris-saint-germain/377nyb`, matchId 5205834) returns 8 stat groups + 46 players; the semifinal (`/matches/paris-saint-germain-vs-arsenal/3775bz`, 4737577) returns an empty shell (`fetchingLeagueData: true`, no `content`). Always check for `props.pageProps.content` before parsing; fall back to the browser otherwise.
- **`/match/<id>` is a 308 redirect, not the page.** A plain fetcher that doesn't follow redirects gets a 54-byte body whose payload IS the canonical path (`/matches/<slug>/<code>`). Either follow the redirect or read that `Location` and fetch the canonical URL.
- **`playerStats` is keyed by playerId, not an array**, and bench players who didn't appear have `stats: []`. Resolve your target player by `name`/`id` and skip empty stat lines.
- **Stat values are positional `[home, away]` pairs** under `content.stats.Periods.All.stats[].stats[].stats`. Map `home`/`away` using `general.homeTeam`/`general.awayTeam`. `xG` values come as strings (`"1.72"`), most others as integers.
- **Search ranking ≠ relevance you want.** `matchSuggest` may surface a related fixture (e.g. the semifinal before the final). Disambiguate using `payload.matchDate`, `leagueName`, and `homeScore`/`awayScore` before committing to a matchId.
- **In a browser, navigate by URL — never rely on `snapshot`/`click`.** FotMob is fully client-rendered; the accessibility snapshot is empty/unreliable. Tabs (Stats, Lineup) can be reached with a `click` (or an `evaluate`) if a screenshot of a specific view is needed, but data extraction should use the rendered body `text` (`{ "method": "text", "params": { "selector": "body" } }`) / `__NEXT_DATA__`.
