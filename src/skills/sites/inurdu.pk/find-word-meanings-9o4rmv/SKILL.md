# InUrdu.pk Name & Vocabulary Meaning Lookup

## Purpose

Look up the meaning of a personal name (Muslim / Pakistani / Arabic / Urdu) — or a thematic vocabulary word — on inurdu.pk and return its structured details: English meaning, Urdu-script meaning (e.g. `عظیم`), Roman-Urdu pronunciation, gender, syllable count, origin/history paragraphs (English + Urdu), and lucky attributes (number, color, alphabets, days, dates, hours, stones, metals). Read-only. The site is a public, server-side-rendered Astro static site fronted by Cloudflare with no observed anti-bot, login, captcha, or JS-only rendering — every field is in the initial HTTP response, so the optimal path is a direct HTTPS fetch with HTML parsing, not browser automation.

## When to Use

- A user asks "what does the name X mean?" / "what is the Urdu meaning of X?" / "is X a boy or girl name?"
- A user wants the Urdu script (Nastaliq) rendering of a given English name.
- A user asks for "lucky" numerological details (lucky number, lucky color, stones, days) tied to a name.
- A user wants Roman-Urdu pronunciation for a name they have only seen written in English or Urdu.
- A user wants Urdu vocabulary for a thematic category (fruits, vegetables, body parts, colors, family relations, days, months, animals, etc.) — these live at `/{topic}-in-urdu/`.
- A user asks for the 99 Names of Allah in Urdu (`/names-of-allah-in-urdu/`).

Do **not** use this skill for: dictionary translation of arbitrary English-to-Urdu sentences (the site only covers names + the curated vocab list), authoritative Islamic-jurisprudence rulings on naming, or numerology advice that goes beyond what the page literally states.

## Workflow

The site exposes a search redirect that turns the lookup into a single HTTP round-trip. Use it. Browser automation is unnecessary overhead here.

1. **Normalize the query.** Lowercase the user-provided name and strip surrounding whitespace. Diacritics and non-ASCII characters can stay in the query string — the redirect handler matches case-insensitively against the canonical lowercase slug.

2. **Hit the search redirect with a plain HTTPS GET, following at most one redirect:**

   ```
   GET https://www.inurdu.pk/?s={url-encoded-query}
   ```

   Run this from any HTTP client — the site is server-rendered and needs no browser. Under restricted egress, route it via `browserless_function`: `page.goto('https://www.inurdu.pk/')` first, then `page.evaluate(async () => fetch('/?s={query}').then(r => r.text()))` (same-origin fetch — the page must be navigated to the origin before any fetch has network egress; parse the returned HTML in-page and return only the extracted fields). No residential proxy is required for a single lookup (see the proxy note below for tight loops).
   - **`302 Location: /name/{slug}/`** → the name exists. Follow the redirect (or fetch the location URL directly) to get the canonical name page.
   - **`200 OK`** with `<h1>Uh oh, no results found</h1>` in the body → the name is not in inurdu.pk's corpus. Return an `outcome: not_found` payload to the caller and stop. Do not invent a meaning; the corpus is curated and missing-from-corpus is meaningful signal.
   - **`301` from the bare apex `inurdu.pk` to `www.inurdu.pk`** is normal — always use the `www.` host to skip it.

3. **Fetch the canonical name page** at `https://www.inurdu.pk/name/{slug}/` (which may also be reached directly if the caller already knows the slug — same lowercase rules). Status `200` on success, `404` on a missing slug.

4. **Parse the HTML** (server-rendered, no JS execution needed). Two reliable extraction strategies:
   - **Structured key/value rows** under the overview card — each `<div class="explain-contents">` contains `<div class="explain-title">{Label}</div>` and `<div class="explain-subtitle">{Value}</div>`. Labels observed: `Name`, `Meaning`, `Urdu Meaning`, `Pronunciation`, `Gender`, `Syllables`.
   - **Lucky grid** — `<div class="lucky-grid">` contains `<div class="lucky-item">` children, each with `<div class="lucky-label">` + `<div class="lucky-value">`. Labels observed: `Lucky Number`, `Lucky Color`, `Lucky Alphabets`, `Lucky Days`, `Lucky Dates`, `Lucky Hours`, `Supportive Numbers`, `Auspicious Stones`, `Auspicious Metals`, `Alternate Stones`.
   - **Long-form description** — the `<h2>{Name} Name Details</h2>` heading is followed by an English paragraph; the `<h2>{Name} Name Details (Urdu)</h2>` heading by an Urdu paragraph. Both live in `<p class="overview-text-subheader">`.
   - **JSON-LD** at `<script type="application/ld+json">` carries `BreadcrumbList` + `Article` schema for the canonical URL + title — useful as a cross-check on the slug-to-name mapping.

5. **For vocabulary lookups** (fruits, vegetables, colors, body parts, etc.), fetch `https://www.inurdu.pk/{topic}-in-urdu/` directly. The list of available topics is in the footer of any page; an abbreviated set includes: `alphabet`, `numbers`, `fruits`, `vegetables`, `family-relations`, `pronouns`, `vowels`, `consonants`, `days-of-the-week`, `months`, `islamic-months`, `seasons`, `dates`, `body-parts`, `emotions`, `dry-fruits`, `spices`, `sweets`, `drinks`, `foods`, `animals`, `plants`, `shapes`, `colors`, `greetings`, `occupations`, `diseases`, `flowers`, `birds`, `insects`, `clothes`, `vehicles`, `musical-instruments`, `weather`, `directions`, `time-words`, `riddles`, `proverbs`, `idioms`. Each page renders an `<div class="alpha-grid">` of `<div class="alpha-card">` items, each containing `<div class="alpha-name">` (Urdu script), `<div class="alpha-sound">English: <b>{English}</b></div>`, and `<div class="alpha-num">{Roman-Urdu transliteration}</div>`.

6. **For browsing the whole name corpus** (e.g. "give me a list of all girl names starting with A"), iterate `/names/{category}/page/{N}/` where category ∈ `{muslim, boy, girl, arabic, urdu, pakistani, islamic}` and N starts at 1. The `<a href="/names/{category}/page/{N+1}/">Next Page</a>` link inside `<div class="paginate">` terminates the iteration when absent. For exhaustive enumeration prefer `https://www.inurdu.pk/sitemap_index.xml`, which fans out to ~40 `/name-sitemap{N}.xml` files listing every `/name/{slug}/` URL.

### Browser fallback

Only fall back to a real browser if Cloudflare ever starts returning challenge pages (none seen during testing — `cf-cache-status` and a normal `cloudflare` server header are the only signs of CF). If needed, one `browserless_agent` call carries the whole flow — a `goto` command then a `text` (or `evaluate`) command to pull the page content:

```json
{
  "commands": [
    {
      "method": "goto",
      "params": {
        "url": "https://www.inurdu.pk/?s=azeem",
        "waitUntil": "load",
        "timeout": 45000
      }
    },
    { "method": "text", "params": { "selector": "body" } }
  ]
}
```

Prefer an `evaluate` command over `text` when you want to parse the overview card / lucky grid in-page and return just the structured fields. No captcha-solve is needed (none encountered). No session-release step: there is nothing to release. The session persists across calls keyed by `proxy`; keep the goto + extract (and any pagination) inside one call's `commands` array to save round-trips, or repeat the same `proxy` on a follow-up call to reconnect to the same session (dropping or changing it lands you in a different, blank session). If you're making many requests in a tight loop and Cloudflare starts rate-limiting, add `proxy: { proxy: "residential" }` to the call; a single lookup does not need it.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **Always use the `www.` host.** The apex `https://inurdu.pk/` issues a `301` to `https://www.inurdu.pk/`. Hard-coding the `www.` form saves one round-trip and avoids tooling that doesn't follow the apex redirect cleanly.
- **Search is a redirect, not an API.** `GET /?s=Ayesha` returns `302 Location: /name/ayesha/`. Configure your HTTP client to follow at most one redirect — chained redirects do not occur here, and unbounded redirect-following is a footgun on any site.
- **Slugs are lowercased.** The user types `Ayesha` or `AYESHA`; the canonical URL is `/name/ayesha/`. The search redirect handles the normalization for you; if you bypass search and hit `/name/{slug}/` directly, lowercase the slug first or you'll get `404`.
- **"No results" is a real, intentional outcome.** When the search query has no match, the response is **`200 OK`** (not 404) with a body that contains `<h1 class="container-card-title">Uh oh, no results found</h1>` and a "Page 1" indicator with zero result cards. Detecting "no results" by status code alone is wrong — match on the heading text or on the absence of `.container-card` elements.
- **The corpus is curated, not algorithmic.** If a name isn't on inurdu.pk, do **not** synthesize a meaning. Common Pakistani / Arabic / Urdu names are well-covered (Azeem, Ayesha, Fatima, Hassan, Ali, etc.) but Western names and uncommon transliterations may legitimately be missing.
- **Urdu-meaning field is comma-separated, in Urdu script.** E.g. for Azeem: `عظیم، معزز، ممتاز`. The separator is an Arabic comma (U+060C, `،`), not an ASCII comma. Don't naively `split(",")` — split on `[،,]` or just present the field as-is.
- **Gender is a free-text field, not an enum.** Values observed: `boy`, `girl`, and (for unisex names like "Azer") both `👧👦` emojis on listing cards. The detail page's `.explain-subtitle` under `Gender` carries a single token; if both genders apply the site typically creates two separate slugs (e.g. `/name/azer/` shows both). Treat the field as a string.
- **Lucky-info fields are not always all present.** Newer or sparser entries may omit `Auspicious Metals` or `Alternate Stones` — code defensively against missing `.lucky-item` rows.
- **Pagination is `/names/{category}/page/{N}/`, not `?page=N`.** Hitting `/names/muslim/?page=2` works for a few categories but is not the canonical form; always use the path segment style emitted by the site's own "Next Page" anchor.
- **The site emits `noindex` on combinatorial filter pages with zero results** per `/robots.txt`. Those URLs still return `200` HTML, but they are not part of the canonical corpus and shouldn't be cached as authoritative.
- **JS execution is not required for any field on this skill's target pages** — every value lives in the initial HTML. Driving a browser is pure overhead unless Cloudflare ever interposes a challenge.
- **No public JSON API exists.** All `/api/*` and similar guess-paths return the site's 404. The HTML + sitemap.xml are the only data surfaces. Don't waste time searching for a JSON endpoint.
