# Craigslist Search Listings

## Purpose

Search Craigslist within a chosen city subdomain and category for postings matching a query, returning each listing's title, price, location/neighborhood, posting date (absolute epoch + relative label), lat/lon, posting ID, and canonical listing URL. Read-only — never posts, edits, replies, or flags. Optimised for the public JSON API at `sapi.craigslist.org`; falls back to the rendered HTML search page when the API is unreachable or geo-locked away from the desired city.

## When to Use

- Hourly or daily monitoring for new postings matching a saved query/category in one or more cities.
- Bulk extraction across multiple cities or sub-areas (cleaner than scraping the JS-rendered search page).
- Building a normalized dataset of for-sale, housing, jobs, or services listings with stable coordinates, prices, and canonical URLs.
- Anywhere you would otherwise scrape Craigslist HTML — the JSON API is faster, cheaper, schema-stable, and returns ~360 listings in a single ~150 KB response.

## Workflow

The Craigslist web UI is a thin JavaScript client over an unauthenticated public JSON API at `https://sapi.craigslist.org`. There is no auth, cookies, captcha, or anti-bot stealth on this endpoint, but it **geo-scopes by request IP** — when no `postal=` parameter is supplied it returns the city corresponding to your outbound IP, ignoring the `Referer` header. Add `postal=<zip>&search_distance=<mi>` to force the desired metro. Call the API via `browserless_function`: `page.goto('https://sapi.craigslist.org/')` first (a bare `fetch` has no egress until the page is on that origin), then `page.evaluate(async () => (await fetch('/web/v8/postings/search/full?...')).json())` — same-origin, no CORS issue; project the result inside the eval (text return is capped ~200k chars). A residential proxy is NOT required (and in fact slows the request without changing the source-IP region). Lead with the API; the rendered-page fallback is ~100× more expensive because the search page is fully JS-rendered (a `snapshot` returns a forest of generic `div/span` nodes with no clickable listing refs).

1. **Pick city + category** (optionally sub-area).
   - **City** = Craigslist subdomain (`sfbay`, `newyork`, `losangeles`, `chicago`, `seattle`, `boston`, …).
   - **Category** = search-path abbreviation: `sss` for-sale-all, `bia` bicycles-all, `cta` cars+trucks, `apa` apartments, `ggg` for-sale-by-owner, `jjj` jobs, `bbb` gigs, etc.
   - **Sub-area** (city-within-region): prefix the category in `searchPath`. E.g. `searchPath=sfc/apa` = SF-proper apartments only (returns ~250 vs. ~9,800 region-wide); `searchPath=eby/cta` = East Bay cars only. Sub-area codes are emitted in each response at `data.decode.locations[i][2]` (`sfc`, `eby`, `nby`, `sby`, `pen`, `que`, `mnh`, `brk`, …). Sub-area scoping is dramatically cheaper than fetching region-wide and filtering client-side.

2. **First page request**:

   ```
   GET https://sapi.craigslist.org/web/v8/postings/search/full
       ?searchPath={cat}
       &query={q}
       &sort={date|rel|priceasc|pricedsc}
       &batch=1-0-360-1-0
       &lang=en&cc=us
       &postal={zip}&search_distance={mi}    # optional but REQUIRED if your IP is in a different metro
   Referer: https://{city}.craigslist.org/
   ```

   Returns JSON with `data.totalResultCount`, `data.items[]` (up to 360 entries), `data.cacheTs`, `data.cacheId` (for pagination), `data.location` (the resolved metro), and `data.decode.*` lookup tables. **Verify scope** via `data.areas` (e.g. `{"3": {"name": "newyork"}}`) and `data.location.url`; if it shows the wrong city, add `postal=` for any ZIP in the target metro plus `search_distance=` (~10–50 mi typically).

   **Common filter params** (append as additional query args; check `data.humanReadableParams` to confirm acceptance — unknown params are silently dropped):
   `min_price`, `max_price`, `min_bedrooms`, `max_bedrooms`, `min_bathrooms`, `min_sqft`, `max_sqft`, `bundleDuplicates=1`, `hasPic=1`, `availabilityMode=available`, `auto_make_model=<text>`, `min_auto_year`, `max_auto_year`, `min_auto_miles`, `max_auto_miles`, `condition=<int>`, `srchType=T` (title-only).

3. **Decode each item — `data.items[]` entries are positional arrays, NOT named-field objects**, and several fields are offsets/lookup keys, not absolute values. Always decode against `data.decode.*`:

   | Position                                | Meaning                                                                               | Resolve via                                                                                                                                                     |
   | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | `item[0]`                               | `postingIdOffset`                                                                     | **postingId = `data.decode.minPostingId + item[0]`**                                                                                                            |
   | `item[1]`                               | `postedDateOffset` (seconds)                                                          | **epoch = `data.decode.minPostedDate + item[1]`**                                                                                                               |
   | `item[2]`                               | `categoryId` (int)                                                                    | Maps to 3-letter sub-category `cat3` used in canonical URLs — undocumented enum, see Gotchas                                                                    |
   | `item[3]`                               | price (integer dollars)                                                               | `0` for free, missing/`-1` for "contact for price"                                                                                                              |
   | `item[4]`                               | `"locIdx[:hoodDescIdx[:hoodIdx]]~lat~lon"`                                            | `data.decode.locations[locIdx]` → `[areaId, city, subareaAbbr]`; lat/lon parse directly from the trailing `~lat~lon`                                            |
   | mid-array `[code, value]` tagged blocks | metadata                                                                              | `code=4` image refs (array); `code=5` `[beds, sqft]` housing meta; `code=6` URL slug string; `code=10` formatted price string ("$1,350"); `code=13` opaque hash |
   | **Title**                               | last array element that is a **plain string** (i.e. not a `[code, ...]` tagged block) | iterate from the end and take the first non-array, non-number element                                                                                           |

   **Why "from the end" matters**: for `sss`/`bia`/`cta` the title is typically `item[-1]`. For housing (`apa`, `roo`, `reb`, …), a trailing `[5, beds, sqft]` block pushes the title to `item[-2]`. Some items also contain a raw integer (e.g. `-12`) mid-array as an image-count flag — your decoder should ignore non-string non-tagged entries when looking for the title.

4. **Construct the canonical post URL**:

   ```
   https://{city}.craigslist.org/{subareaAbbr}/{cat3}/d/{slug}/{postingId}.html
   ```
   - `postingId` from step 3 (offset + `minPostingId`).
   - `subareaAbbr` from `data.decode.locations[locIdx][2]` (`sfc`, `eby`, `nby`, `sby`, `pen`, `que`, `mnh`, `brk`, …); if the locations row has only 2 elements (no sub-area abbreviation), the sub-area segment can be omitted and Craigslist will still resolve via redirect.
   - `cat3` from the categoryId enum (see Gotchas — undocumented).
   - `slug` from the `[6, "..."]` tagged block.

   **Fallback when `cat3` is unknown**: `https://{city}.craigslist.org/search/{cat}?postingId={postingId}` redirects to the canonical URL. Always works; cheaper than re-deriving the enum.

5. **Paginate (only when `totalResultCount > 360`)**:
   ```
   GET https://sapi.craigslist.org/web/v8/postings/search/batch
       ?batch=1-{OFFSET}-1080-1-0-{startTs}-{endTs}
       &cacheId={data.cacheId from step 2}
       &lang=en&cc=us
   Referer: https://{city}.craigslist.org/
   ```
   Increment `OFFSET` in steps of 1080. `startTs = data.cacheTs` (from step 2), `endTs = current epoch`. Same `data.decode.*` semantics; `cacheId` ties continuation pages to the original snapshot.

### Browser fallback (use only when the JSON API is unreachable / geo-locked / rate-limited)

The rendered `/search/{cat}` page is fully JS-rendered. Open it directly (bypass the geo-redirect from `www.craigslist.org`):

```
https://{city}.craigslist.org/search/{cat}?query={q}&sort=date
```

Then either:

- **Recommended**: an `html` command (`{ "method": "html", "params": { "selector": "body" } }`) returns the post-render DOM — regex-match against it (or fold the parse into an `evaluate`). Skip `snapshot` / `click` — snapshot returns thousands of unstructured nodes with no listing-anchor refs, and click-through costs ~3 turns per listing.

Per-listing chunks are reliably delimited by `data-pid="(\d+)" class="cl-search-result`. Within each chunk:

| Field                  | Regex                                                                                         |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Posting ID             | from the chunk-splitter capture group above                                                   |
| Canonical URL          | `class="[^"]*posting-title[^"]*"[^>]+href="(https://[^"]+\.html)"`                            |
| Title                  | `posting-title"><span class="label">([^<]+)</span>`                                           |
| Posted relative        | `<span class="result-posted-date">([^<]+)</span>` (e.g. `&lt;1hr ago`, `2 hours ago`, `4/30`) |
| Location/neighborhood  | `<span class="result-location">([^<]+)</span>`                                                |
| Price                  | `<span class="priceinfo">([^<]+)</span>` (absent for free / "contact" listings)               |
| Housing meta (apa/roo) | `<span class="[^"]*housing[^"]*">([^<]+)</span>`                                              |

Validated 2026-05-28 on `sfbay/sss?query=bicycle&sort=date` — a single `html` command returned 200 listing chunks, 200 titles, 200 dates, 200 locations, 184 prices (16 free/contact) with the patterns above.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **Geo-redirect on bare domain**: `https://www.craigslist.org/` redirects to a city based on the request IP. Always open `{city}.craigslist.org` directly; never depend on `Referer` to select the city for either the website or the API.
- **API geolocates by request IP — `postal=<zip>&search_distance=<mi>` is the override.** Without `postal`, `sapi.craigslist.org` silently returns results for the metro covering your outbound IP, even when `Referer: newyork.craigslist.org` is set. Add `postal=<any zip in the target metro>` plus `search_distance=<mi>` to force the result set. Verified 2026-05-28: from a sandbox IP that geolocates to SF Bay, requesting `searchPath=sss&query=guitar&postal=10001&search_distance=10` correctly returned `data.areas: {"3": {"name": "newyork"}}` with 928 NYC results. **A residential proxy does NOT change this** — the proxy egress IP is still typically not in the target metro, so `postal=` is the only reliable override. Always validate scope via `data.areas` and `data.location.url` in the response.
- **`item[0]` is NOT the postingId** — it's an offset. Absolute id = `data.decode.minPostingId + item[0]`. Treating `item[0]` as the postingId is the #1 source of 404s on the constructed URL.
- **Posted timestamps are also offset-encoded**: absolute epoch (seconds) = `data.decode.minPostedDate + item[1]`. The rendered HTML page only shows relative ("< 1hr ago", "2 hours ago", "4/30"); the API is the only path to absolute time.
- **`data.decode.locations` indexing is per-response, not stable across requests.** The decode table is rebuilt per cache TTL; the same metro/sub-area may appear at a different `locIdx` between consecutive queries. **Always resolve `locations[locIdx]` from the response in hand** — never cache or hardcode the table.
- **`categoryId → cat3` is an undocumented enum** that the response does NOT supply. Observed mappings (composite across iterations and reference data): `1→apa`, `5→fua` (furniture), `20→bia` (bicycles for sale), `68→bik` (bicycles), `93→spo` (sporting goods), `96→msg` (musical instruments — observed 2026-05-28 in `sss?query=guitar` against newyork), `101→foa`, `107→bar`, `122→pts` (auto parts), `141→bfa` (business), `172→bik` (electric/specialty bikes), `197→bop` (bicycle parts/accessories). **Unknown categoryIds**: don't try to guess — use the redirect fallback `https://{city}.craigslist.org/search/{cat}?postingId={id}` which 302-redirects to the canonical URL with the correct `cat3`.
- **Title-extraction must scan from the END of the item array, not a fixed index.** For housing categories (`apa`, `roo`, `reb`), a trailing `[5, beds, sqft]` block pushes the title to `item[-2]`. Some items contain raw negative integers mid-array (observed `-12`, `-4`, `-2` — likely image-count or status flags); these are not titles. **Rule**: iterate from `length-1` downward, skip arrays and skip numbers, take the first plain string.
- **Snapshot is useless on `/search/` pages.** A `snapshot` command returns >10k nodes on the rendered search page, none of which are accessibility-tagged listing anchors. Don't waste turns iterating over refs — use an `html` command + regex, or (preferred) the JSON API.
- **Regex-match the returned HTML directly** — the `html` command gives you the post-render DOM string; feed it straight to your chunk regex (or do the extraction in-page via `evaluate` and return compact JSON).
- **Sub-area scoping is much cheaper than client-side filtering.** Example: `apa` region-wide returned 9,798 SF Bay rentals; `sfc/apa` returned 253 SF-proper rentals — same data shape, ~40× less to download.
- **Neighborhood labels are inconsistent across responses and categories.** `data.decode.locationDescriptions` is rebuilt per cache TTL; the same neighborhood ("Russian Hill") may appear under different indices in two consecutive `apa` calls, and may be entirely absent from the decode table for a different category (`cta`) even in the same metro. **For neighborhood-scoped searches, fall back to lat/lon bounding-box matching on the `lat~lon` in `item[4]`** rather than label-string equality.
- **Free / "contact for price" listings**: `item[3]` may be `0` (free) or absent / `-1` (no price set). The `[10, "$X"]` tagged block is also missing on those.
- **Rate-limiting is self-imposed but real.** No formal block was observed during validation, but bursts >5 req/s on the same `/search/full` endpoint can stall. Keep ≤1 req/s sustained; add 200–500 ms jitter on pagination loops.
- **Cache freshness**: API responses set `Cache-Control: public, max-age=900`; `data.cacheTs` reflects the snapshot epoch. If you need sub-15-minute freshness, expect identical results on repeated calls — the upstream cache is what's slow, not your code.
- **No residential proxy needed.** Routing the sapi fetch through a residential proxy costs more wall-time than a direct `browserless_function` fetch and does NOT solve the geo-scoping problem (proxy egress IP is still rarely in the target metro). Use `postal=` instead.

Outcome shapes you may encounter:

- **`success`** — normal case, `total_results > 0`, `listings[].length > 0`.
- **`success_empty`** — query returned no matches: `total_results: 0, listings: []`. The response shape is unchanged; just an empty array.
- **`scope_mismatch`** — `data.areas` returned a different metro than requested (caller forgot `postal=`). Detectable by comparing `resolved_area.name` to the intended `city` subdomain; surface as a warning and retry with `postal=`.
- **`unknown_category_id`** — `item[2]` not in the local `cat3` enum. Use the `?postingId=` redirect fallback URL rather than guessing; surface `cat3: null` and a `url_via_redirect` field.
- **`browser_fallback`** — same `listings[]` schema, populated via the `cl-search-result` regex set against the `html` command's output. Fields that the rendered DOM omits (absolute epoch, lat/lon, area-id) become `null` or are derived from the relative-time string and the `data-pid` only.
