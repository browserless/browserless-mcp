# Domain.com.au — Find Properties for Sale

## Purpose

Enumerate residential and project properties currently listed for sale on Domain.com.au and return structured data per listing (address, suburb/state/postcode, property type, beds/baths/parking, sale method, agency + agent contacts, lat/lon, features, listed/modified timestamps, and the canonical listing URL). Read-only — never submits enquiries, never books inspections.

## When to Use

- "Show me what's for sale in Sydney NSW 2000" / "show me new for-sale listings posted today on Domain"
- Daily monitoring of new sale listings in one or more suburbs / postcodes / states.
- Bulk extraction of for-sale inventory for an analytics pipeline.
- Anywhere you'd be tempted to scrape `/sale/{suburb}/` HTML — that path is hard-blocked by Akamai (see Site-Specific Gotchas); the sitemap → per-listing detail-page route below is the actual working path.

## Workflow

Domain.com.au is hosted behind **Akamai Bot Manager Premier**. The HTML _search/index_ pages at `/sale/{state}/`, `/sale/{suburb}-{state}-{postcode}/`, etc. are reliably blocked even from a residential-proxy `browserless_agent` session — both a direct `goto` and a UI click-through from the homepage land on Akamai's `Access Denied` page. **Do not attempt to enumerate listings by browsing the search-results pages.** The recommended path is the sitemap → per-listing flow below; it relies on Domain's own publicly-advertised `robots.txt`-listed sitemaps and the `__NEXT_DATA__` JSON embedded in each listing-detail HTML page. Always pass a residential proxy (`proxy: { proxy: "residential", proxyCountry: "au" }`) on **every** call — the `browserless_agent` session persists across calls, keyed by `proxy`/`profile`, so repeating the same proxy reconnects to the same warmed session (dropping or changing it lands you in a different, blank session).

### 1. Discover listing URLs from the public sitemap

The sitemap index is freely fetchable (no Akamai challenge on these XML endpoints):

```
GET https://www.domain.com.au/sitemap-listings-sale.xml
```

That returns a `<sitemapindex>` referencing 9 numbered chunks plus a "last 24 hours" chunk:

```
https://www.domain.com.au/sitemap-listings-sale-1.xml.gz          (~20 000 URLs each)
…
https://www.domain.com.au/sitemap-listings-sale-9.xml.gz
https://www.domain.com.au/sitemap-listings-sale-last24hours.xml.gz  (~1 300 URLs, new today)
```

Pick `last24hours.xml.gz` for the new-listings-today use case; iterate `1.xml.gz`..`9.xml.gz` for the full ≈180 k for-sale inventory.

Fetch a chunk inside a `browserless_agent` call: `goto` the domain origin first (warms egress + Akamai cookies), then an `evaluate` that fetches the `.xml.gz`, gunzips it in-page with the browser-native `DecompressionStream('gzip')`, and returns the `<loc>` URL list. Pass the residential proxy on the call.

```json
{
  "proxy": { "proxy": "residential", "proxyCountry": "au" },
  "commands": [
    {
      "method": "goto",
      "params": {
        "url": "https://www.domain.com.au/",
        "waitUntil": "load",
        "timeout": 45000
      }
    },
    {
      "method": "evaluate",
      "params": {
        "content": "(async()=>{ const res = await fetch('https://www.domain.com.au/sitemap-listings-sale-last24hours.xml.gz'); const xml = await new Response(res.body.pipeThrough(new DecompressionStream('gzip'))).text(); return JSON.stringify([...xml.matchAll(/https:\\/\\/www\\.domain\\.com\\.au\\/[^<]+/g)].map(m=>m[0])); })()"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The evaluate result comes back under `.value`. A browser won't auto-decompress a `.gz` body served as `application/gzip`, hence the explicit `DecompressionStream`. Then filter the URL list by substring (below) before fetching any detail pages.

Each `<loc>` is a canonical listing URL of the form:

```
https://www.domain.com.au/{optional-street-prefix-}{suburb}-{state}-{postcode}-{listingId}
```

- `{listingId}` is a 10-digit integer (e.g. `2020775678`); same id as Domain's internal listingId.
- `{state}` is one of `nsw|vic|qld|wa|sa|tas|act|nt`.
- `{suburb}` is the kebab-cased suburb name.
- `{postcode}` is the 4-digit Australian postcode.

**Suburb / state / postcode filtering is a pure substring match on the URL** — no need to fetch each page to filter. Example: Sydney CBD listings → `grep -- '-sydney-nsw-2000-'`. NSW only → `grep -E '-nsw-[0-9]{4}-[0-9]+$'`.

### 2. Fetch each listing's detail page and extract `__NEXT_DATA__`

Each listing-detail HTML contains a `<script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">…</script>` block (Next.js SSR payload). The data you need lives at `props.pageProps.componentProps`. `goto` the listing and parse `__NEXT_DATA__` **in-page** with an `evaluate` — no need to ship the ~500 KB HTML back:

```json
{
  "proxy": { "proxy": "residential", "proxyCountry": "au" },
  "commands": [
    {
      "method": "goto",
      "params": {
        "url": "https://www.domain.com.au/roseville-nsw-2069-2020775497",
        "waitUntil": "load",
        "timeout": 45000
      }
    },
    {
      "method": "evaluate",
      "params": {
        "content": "(()=>{ const el=document.getElementById('__NEXT_DATA__'); if(!el){ return JSON.stringify({blocked:true}); } const cp=JSON.parse(el.textContent).props.pageProps.componentProps; return JSON.stringify({ listingId: cp.listingId, url: cp.listingUrl, address: cp.address, street: cp.street, streetNumber: cp.streetNumber, unitNumber: cp.unitNumber, suburb: cp.suburb, state: cp.stateAbbreviation, postcode: cp.postcode, propertyType: cp.propertyType, beds: cp.beds, baths: (cp.listingSummary||{}).baths, parking: (cp.listingSummary||{}).parking, saleMethod: (cp.listingSummary||{}).method, mode: (cp.listingSummary||{}).mode, status: (cp.listingSummary||{}).status, headline: cp.headline, title: (cp.listingSummary||{}).title, selfPrice: (((cp.listingsMap||{})[cp.listingId]||{}).listingModel||{}).price, agencyName: cp.agencyName, agents: ((cp.priceGuide||{}).agents||[]).map(a=>({name:a.name,phone:a.phone,email:a.email})), estimatedPrice: (cp.priceGuide||{}).estimatedPrice, lat: (cp.map||{}).latitude, lon: (cp.map||{}).longitude, features: cp.features, isArchived: cp.isArchived, createdOn: cp.createdOn, modifiedOn: cp.modifiedOn }); })()"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The projection comes back under `.value`. If the evaluate returns `{blocked:true}` (no `__NEXT_DATA__` in the DOM), the page was Akamai-challenged — treat as "blocked; retry after backoff", do **not** ship as a real result.

A 200-OK response is ≈500 KB of HTML. An Akamai-blocked response is **either** a 2 592-byte body that opens with `<!DOCTYPE html><html lang="en"><body><script type="text/javascript" src="/f_EAs/…"` (the Akamai BMP JS challenge page — no `__NEXT_DATA__`), **or** a 403 with a 5 89-byte `<TITLE>Access Denied</TITLE>` body. Treat both as "blocked; retry after backoff" — do **not** ship as a real result.

### 3. Throttle and retry

Even with a residential proxy, individual listing loads will start returning Akamai challenges (200 + ~2.5 KB body, no `__NEXT_DATA__`) and hard 403 / Access-Denied bodies after a handful of rapid requests. Empirically: ≥10–30 s between loads is the right sustained pace; bursts of 2–3 quick loads before throttling are usually tolerated. On a challenge or 403, back off for 30–60 s and retry. The `last24hours` chunk has ≈1 300 URLs/day, so a 15 s sustained cadence (~96 loads/day budgeted at 15 s = ~5.5 h) is feasible for a full pass.

For a one-shot "show me listings in Sydney NSW 2000": filter the sitemap URL list for `-sydney-nsw-2000-`, take the first 10–20, load each `browserless_agent` call ~15 s apart, and you'll have a clean structured result set.

### Browser fallback

A stealth Browserbase session (`a stealth + residential-proxy session`, region `ap-southeast-1` for best results) can open the **homepage** (`https://www.domain.com.au/`) and an individual listing-detail URL **once or twice from a fresh session** before Akamai escalates to `Access Denied`. The accessibility-tree snapshot of the loaded listing-detail page contains the same address/beds/baths/agent info, but per-session this path doesn't scale past a handful of URLs and the `__NEXT_DATA__` route (above) is strictly better. Never rely on the browser to enumerate the `/sale/{suburb}/` index pages — those are blocked at first nav from every session we tried (`a stealth + residential-proxy session` in both `us-west-2` and `ap-southeast-1`, with and without `the solve command`).

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **`/sale/{state}/`, `/sale/{suburb}-{state}-{postcode}/`, `/sale/{location}/{type}/`, `/sale/{location}/{type}/{N}-bedrooms/` index pages are hard-blocked by Akamai** for both browser-driven sessions and a residential-proxy HTTP fetch. Browser nav lands on a JS-less `Access Denied` page (title literally `"Access Denied"`, ref `18.*.*.*`). Fetch returns either the same `Access Denied` 403 or a 2 592-byte Akamai BMP JS challenge that needs a real browser to solve — the homepage already loaded those cookies but the protection layer on `/sale/` is independent.
- **Sitemaps are not blocked.** `https://www.domain.com.au/sitemap-listings-sale.xml` (index) and the `…-{1..9}.xml.gz` + `…-last24hours.xml.gz` chunks return cleanly via a residential-proxy HTTP fetch. They're listed in `robots.txt`, so this is the officially-blessed enumeration path.
- **a direct HTTP fetch returns body bytes base64-encoded for binary content** — `.xml.gz` sitemap chunks come back as `H4sIAAAAAAAA…` (base64-of-gzip). `base64 -d input.b64 > out.gz && gunzip -c out.gz` to read them. For HTML the body comes through as UTF-8 directly via `--output`.
- **Listing URLs are NOT under `/sale/`** — they're at the bare-domain root: `https://www.domain.com.au/{optional-street-}{suburb}-{state}-{postcode}-{listingId}`. The `street` prefix is optional and present only when the address is publicly displayed (some new-development listings show only suburb-level location).
- **The `__NEXT_DATA__` JSON is the entire SSR payload** — about 500 KB for a typical apartment listing. Parse it with `JSON.parse()` and read `props.pageProps.componentProps`. Useful sub-keys: `listingId`, `address`, `suburb`, `stateAbbreviation`, `postcode`, `propertyType`, `beds`, `listingSummary.{baths,parking,method,mode,status,title}`, `agencyName`, `priceGuide.{agents[],estimatedPrice}`, `map.{latitude,longitude}`, `features[]`, `headline`, `isArchived`, `createdOn`, `modifiedOn`, `listingsMap[id].listingModel.price` (the displayed price text for the listing).
- **Price is not always a number.** Domain's `componentProps.priceGuide.estimatedPrice` is frequently `{from:null,to:null}` because the agent has set the listing to "display suburb only" (`componentProps.displayType === 'suburbOnly'`) or "contact agent". The actually-displayed text (e.g. `"Auction - Contact Agent"`, `"Private Sale: $2,600,000 - $2,700,000"`, `"CONTACT AGENT"`) lives at `componentProps.listingsMap[listingId].listingModel.price`. Always emit both: the raw display text and the parsed numeric range (or `null`).
- **`saleMethod` values observed:** `privateTreaty`, `auction`. `mode` is always `buy` for for-sale listings; if `mode === 'rent'` you're on a rental listing — drop it.
- **`isArchived: true` listings are still in the sitemap for a short window.** Skip them unless the caller specifically asked for off-market history. The `last24hours.xml.gz` chunk occasionally contains a just-archived listing whose detail page still renders.
- **Rate-limit pattern.** Akamai BMP doesn't return `429`; instead, blocked requests come back as one of: (a) 200 + ~2 592-byte JS-challenge body (no `__NEXT_DATA__`), (b) 403 + ~589-byte `<TITLE>Access Denied</TITLE>` body. Detect by `size < 5000 || !html.includes('__NEXT_DATA__')` and retry with backoff ≥ 30 s. ≥ 15 s sustained spacing between detail-page fetches works in practice.
- **Don't waste time on the "Domain Group API" link.** `https://developer.domain.com.au/` is a real OAuth-protected developer portal (api.domain.com.au + Bearer token), but every documentation URL we hit returned a `Refresh: 0;url=…` redirect followed by a Next.js 404 page (`<title>Page Not Found | Domain Developer Portal</title>`). Naive POST to `api.domain.com.au/v1/listings/residential/_search` returns `{"title":"Not Found","detail":"No Matching Route"}`. Without a registered OAuth client + access token, the API path is **not** open; the sitemap + detail-page route documented above is the unauth path. If you have an OAuth token, swap this skill for a direct API call.
- **GraphQL endpoint exists but is unverified.** `props.pageProps.componentProps.graphqlApi` is exposed in the detail-page `__NEXT_DATA__` but we did not confirm it accepts cookieless POSTs from outside the page context. Treat as "don't waste time" until verified, and use the sitemap route.
- **Region matters for fetching speed, not for unblocking.** A Browserbase session in `ap-southeast-1` (Singapore — closest to AU) and one in `us-west-2` were both equally blocked on `/sale/*` pages and equally tolerated on listing-detail and sitemap fetches. Pick `ap-southeast-1` for marginally lower latency; it is not a workaround for the index-page block.
- **`the solve command` does not help.** The block we see is Akamai BMP behavioural-fingerprint denial, not a Google reCAPTCHA challenge. Adding `the solve command` to the session create call leaves the `Access Denied` outcome unchanged.
- **READ-ONLY skill.** Never click "Enquire", "Apply", "Book Inspection", "Make Offer", or any agent-contact submit button — those start a workflow that emails the agent.
