# eBay Search Products

## Purpose

Search eBay's consumer site for listings matching a keyword query (with optional category, condition, price, location, format, and sort filters) and return the matching results as structured JSON — title, item ID, condition, listing format, price, shipping, location, seller, watchers, sold/sold-date (in Sold mode), and canonical `/itm/{itemId}` URL per listing, plus the page-wide result count and active-filter chips. Also supports the **Sold/Completed** cross-section for comp pricing. **Read-only — never click Buy It Now, Place Bid, Make Offer, Add to Watchlist, Add to Cart, or Sign In.**

## When to Use

- "Find listings for `<query>`" — keyword search across the whole site or scoped to a category.
- Comp-pricing research — "what did `<query>` recently sell for on eBay?" (Sold + Completed mode).
- Auction monitoring — "what auctions for `<query>` end in the next hour?" (`LH_Auction=1&_sop=1`).
- Inventory checks for resellers — "any new Top Rated Plus listings of `<query>` posted in the last day?" (`_sop=10&LH_TopRatedPlus=1`).
- Batch item-ID lookup — when given a list of itemIds, hit `/itm/{itemId}` directly (browser fallback below).
- Anywhere you'd otherwise want eBay's official **Browse API** but lack production-app approval (it's partner-gated — see Gotchas).

## Workflow

eBay's **Browse API** (`api.ebay.com/buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search`) is the cleanest data path but is gated behind the eBay Developer Program's production-approval workflow — most agents will not have a Bearer token. The pragmatic, always-available surface is the consumer SRP at `https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html`, which renders mostly as server-rendered HTML in the new `.s-card` layout. **Lead with browser scraping. Mention the Browse API only if your environment has approved credentials.**

eBay is fronted by Akamai. **A bare HTTP fetch is unusable** — a raw HTTP fetch (no proxy) is redirected to `/splashui/challenge` (Akamai JS interstitial), and a proxied raw fetch returns `403 Access Denied` from `errors.edgesuite.net`. You need a real Chrome session with **stealth + residential proxies** (`browserless_agent` with `proxy: { proxy: "residential" }`). Even with both, 40–60% of fresh sessions land on the static `Access Denied` page on first navigation — **plan for retries on 403** (see Gotchas).

### 1. Build the search URL

Always assemble URL parameters explicitly rather than relying on the page UI. The parameter surface (verified during this skill's development against the live site):

| Parameter                 | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `_nkw=<query>`            | Keyword query (URL-encoded; `+` for spaces). The only required field.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `_sacat=<id>`             | Category leaf id (e.g. `183454` = CCG Individual Cards, `9355` = Cell Phones & Smartphones). Maps to eBay's nested taxonomy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Example URLs (all verified to render listings during skill development):

- Keyword + size aspect: `https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=vintage+Levi+501+size+32&_ipg=60`
- Sold/comp mode: `https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=iphone+12&LH_Sold=1&LH_Complete=1&_ipg=60`
- Category leaf + condition: `https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=Charizard&_sacat=183454&LH_ItemCondition=3000&_sop=15&_ipg=60`

If the input is **already a full SRP URL**, use it as-is; if augmenting, parse and merge query params.

### 2. Open in a stealth + residential-proxy session, retry on 403

Call `browserless_agent` with `proxy: { proxy: "residential", proxyCountry: "us" }` (a stealth session on a US residential IP — without it you hit `/splashui/challenge` instantly). Each call is one ephemeral session, so a "retry" is simply a fresh call — which is exactly the behavior you want, since eBay's Akamai blocks ~40-60% of residential IPs on first connect and rotating to a new IP is cheaper than solving the challenge. Put navigate + settle + title-check in one call's `commands` array:

```jsonc
// browserless_agent, proxy: { proxy: "residential", proxyCountry: "us" }
[
  {
    "method": "goto",
    "params": { "url": "<URL>", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 },
  },
  { "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 2500 } },
  {
    "method": "evaluate",
    "params": { "content": "(()=>JSON.stringify({title: document.title}))()" },
  },
]
```

If the returned `title` contains `Access Denied` or `Pardon Our Interruption`, discard the result and issue a **fresh** `browserless_agent` call (a new ephemeral session = a new residential IP). Repeat up to 3–4 times; empirically 2–3 rotations reach a clean IP. Do not try to solve the splash UI — cycling to a new IP is cheaper and faster.

A clean SRP page-title looks like `Vintage Levi 501 Size 32 for sale | eBay`. A blocked one is exactly `Access Denied` (Akamai static error from `errors.edgesuite.net`) or `Pardon Our Interruption...` (the `/splashui/challenge` JS interstitial). Once a call lands clean, fold the extraction (step 3) into the **same** call's `commands` array so you don't burn a fresh session re-navigating.

### 3. Extract listings from the `.s-card` DOM

eBay migrated the SRP to a new `.s-card` markup. The legacy `.s-item__*` selectors **do not match anymore** on the live site (`hasSItem: false`, `hasSCard: true` confirmed across multiple iterations). Use an `evaluate` command (parse in-page and return a compact JSON projection, not raw DOM) with this selector set:

| Target                                               | Selector                                                                                                            |

  "or Best Offer",                    // buy-format row
  "+$27.11 delivery",                 // shipping row
  "Located in Canada",                // location row

  "View similar active items",        // eBay-injected nav (skip)
  "Sell one like this",               // eBay-injected nav (skip)
  "S⁣4⁣p⁣o⁣n⁣s⁣o⁣r⁣e⁣d..." // sponsored marker (last row, obfuscated — see Gotchas)
]
```

Classify each row by regex:

| Field             | Regex                                                                                                                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `priceText`       | `/^\$[\d,]/` (strip the strikethrough overlap; see Gotchas)                                                              |
| `buyFormat`       | `/buy it now\|or best offer\|best offer accepted\|auction/i`                                                             |
| `bidCount`        | `/^(\d+)\s+bids?\b/i`                                                                                                    |
| `shipping`        | `/^\+\$\|^free delivery\|^free shipping\|delivery$\|shipping$/i`                                                         |
| `location`        | `/^located in /i` (capture rest as country/region)                                                                       |
| `returnsAccepted` | `/^free returns$/i` (boolean)                                                                                            |

### 4. Build the JSON per listing

```jsonc
{
  "itemId": "227321194210", // from /itm/{id} in URL
  "url": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/227321194210",
  "title": "Levi's 501 Men's Jeans Vintage 90s Size 32x33...",
  "condition": "Pre-Owned", // first segment of .s-card__subtitle before " · "
  "itemSpecifics": ["Size 32"], // remaining " · "-separated segments
  "price": { "text": "$80.00", "value": 80.0, "currency": "USD" },
  "wasPrice": null, // strikethrough portion if the price node is $X$Y
  "listingFormat": "BuyItNow", // BuyItNow | Auction | BuyItNow+BestOffer | BestOfferAccepted | Auction+BuyItNow
  "bidCount": null, // integer; null for fixed-price
  "timeLeft": null, // ISO 8601 datetime if extractable from per-item detail; null for fixed-price
  "shipping": { "text": "+$8.29 delivery", "value": 8.29, "free": false },
  "location": {
    "text": "Located in United States",
    "country": "United States",
  },
  "totalWithShipping": 88.29, // priced + shipping when both numeric
  "imageUrl": "https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/.../s-l500.webp",
  "seller": null, // {"username":"buybackboss","feedbackPct":99.6,"feedbackScore":34300}; surfaces on most Sold-mode + some active cards
  "topRatedPlus": false, // not surfaced in card markup — confirm via `LH_TopRatedPlus=1` query if needed
  "returnsAccepted": false, // true when "Free returns" row present
  "authenticityGuarantee": false, // appears as a row in supported categories (sneakers, watches, handbags, trading cards >$250)
  "watchers": null, // from "X watchers" row
  "soldCount": null, // from "X sold" row
  "categoryBreadcrumbs": [], // page-wide; read from .x-categories__list once per page
  "sponsored": false, // see U+2063 gotcha
}
```

### 5. Capture page-wide context once

```jsonc
{
  "resultCountText": "776 results for vintage Levi 501 size 32", // or "18,000+ results..." with comma+plus suffix
  "resultCount": 776, // parse leading integer; preserve "approx" flag if "+" suffix
  "appliedFilters": [{ "label": "Size: Regular 32", "removable": true }],
  "breadcrumbs": [
    "All",
    "Clothing, Shoes & Accessories",
    "Men",
    "Men's Clothing",
    "Jeans",
  ],
  "shippingToZip": "37918", // from .b-header__row text; reflects proxy IP. Override with &_stpos=<ZIP>.
  "sortOrder": "Best Match", // current value of the sort dropdown
  "pageNumber": 1,
  "itemsPerPage": 60,
}
```

### 6. Sold-listings mode (comp pricing)

URL: `&LH_Sold=1&LH_Complete=1`. Always pair both flags — `LH_Sold=1` alone is silently rewritten by eBay to the active-listings view.

In Sold mode, the same `.s-card` selectors apply. Distinguishing fields (verified empirically with `_nkw=iphone+12&LH_Sold=1&LH_Complete=1`):

- **Bid count** in the attribute rows is the FINAL bid count: `41 bids`.
- **"Best offer accepted"** in the buy-format row marks an OBO sale (vs `or Best Offer` on active listings).
- **Seller row surfaces here** (active SRP often omits it): `buybackboss 99.6% positive (34.3K)` — username + feedback% + score (`34.3K` → `34300`, `1.4M` → `1400000`).
- **The "2 filters applied" pill** appears in the controls bar — confirms Sold+Completed are both active.
- **Sold date / sold-price are the same `.s-card__price`** — the listing already closed at this number. Treat `priceText` as `soldPrice`, surface `soldDate` only if you can extract it from a per-card caption row (one of the `.s-card__caption--signal` / `.s-card__footer-caption` slots — not consistently populated; see Honest Gap below).

### Browser fallback (when given an itemId list, not a query)

For input shape "list of itemIds", skip the SRP and hit each item's detail page:

```
https://www.ebay.com/itm/{itemId}
```

The same stealth + residential-proxy session is required (same Akamai). On the detail page, extract:

- Title: `h1.x-item-title__mainTitle span.ux-textspans`
- Price: `.x-price-primary .ux-textspans` (parse currency + amount)
- Bids / time-left (auctions): `.x-bid-count .ux-textspans`, `.ux-timer__time .ux-textspans`
- Condition: `.x-item-condition-text .ux-textspans`
- Seller info: `.x-sellercard-atf__info__about-seller a` (username), `.x-sellercard-atf__data-item-block` (feedback)
- Shipping: `.ux-labels-values--shipping`
- Item specifics: `.ux-layout-section-evo__item--table-view dl` (definition list)
- Image gallery: `.ux-image-carousel-item img`
- Canonical URL: from `<link rel="canonical">`

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **READ-ONLY.** Never click `Buy It Now`, `Place bid`, `Make offer`, `Add to Watchlist`, `Add to cart`, or `Sign in`. Stop at the rendered SRP / item-detail. Output is structured JSON only.
- **Akamai is the entire gate.** A bare HTTP fetch is redirected to `https://www.ebay.com/splashui/challenge?ap=1&appName=orch&ru=...` (the JS interstitial that bare HTTP cannot pass). A proxied raw fetch returns a hard `403 Access Denied` from `errors.edgesuite.net`. **You need a real Chrome session via `browserless_agent` with stealth + residential proxies (`proxy: { proxy: "residential" }`).** Headed/headless does not matter; the JS-fingerprint check does.
- **Even with stealth + residential proxies, ~40–60% of fresh sessions get blocked on first navigation** — Akamai pre-tags certain residential-proxy IP ranges. The page either renders an `Access Denied` HTML (title literally `Access Denied`, `Reference #<id>.<id>.<id>.<id>`, link to `errors.edgesuite.net`) or shows `Pardon Our Interruption...` (splash UI). **Treat 403 as "rotate to a new session and retry" — issue a fresh `browserless_agent` call, up to 3–4 attempts. Empirically 2–3 rotations reach a clean IP.** Do not try to solve the splash UI; cycling to a new ephemeral session (new IP) is cheaper and faster.
- **Don't waste time on the eBay Browse API without approved credentials.** `https://api.ebay.com/buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search` requires a production-app OAuth Bearer issued through eBay's Developer Program, which gates production access behind a partner-approval review (typically multiple weeks). Sandbox tokens point at a different host and return only test inventory. **Without approved credentials, browser scraping is the only path.** If the agent has credentials, lead with the API.
- **Mobile site (`m.ebay.com`) and the RSS feed (`&_rss=1`) are also Akamai-gated** — both returned 403 with proxies during testing. Don't bother bouncing through them.
- **The SRP uses the new `.s-card` markup, not legacy `.s-item__*`.** Verified across 4+ iterations: `hasSCard: true, hasSItem: false`. Selectors like `.s-item__title`, `.s-item__price`, `.s-item__seller-info-text` do not match on the live site. The new class set is `.s-card__title`, `.s-card__subtitle`, `.s-card__price`, `.s-card__attribute-row`, `.s-card__footer--row`.
- **The first `.s-card` is always a "Shop on eBay" placeholder card** with `title="Shop on eBay"`, fake `price="$20.00"`, fake `href="https://ebay.com/itm/123456?..."` and `&hash=item123546`. **Filter it out** by `itemId === "123456"`, `title === "Shop on eBay"`, or the absence of `data-listingid` on the `<li>`.
- **The "Sponsored" marker is obfuscated with U+2063 (INVISIBLE SEPARATOR) and decoy letters to defeat scrapers.** The DOM string is e.g. `S⁣4⁣p⁣o⁣n⁣s⁣o⁣ ⁣Y⁣ ⁣r⁣e⁣d⁣...` — visually reads "Sponsored" but a naive `text.includes("Sponsored")` returns `false`. **Normalize before testing:** `text.replace(/[⁠-⁤​-‍﻿]/g, '').replace(/\s+/g, '')` then `.toLowerCase().includes("sponsored")`. The marker always appears in the last attribute row, after seller info.
- **Price node concatenates sale + strikethrough with no separator** — a price like "$92.92" with strikethrough original "$109.32" renders in the DOM as the single string `"$92.92$109.32"`. Parse with `/^(\$[\d,.]+)(\$[\d,.]+)?$/` and treat capture 2 as `wasPrice`.
- **Price ranges for multi-variant listings**: `"$0.99 to $3.00"` — capture as `priceMin` / `priceMax`.
- **Subtitle is condition + key item-specifics, joined by " · "**: `"Pre-Owned · Size 32"`, `"Pre-Owned · Apple iPhone 12 · 128 GB · Unlocked"`, `"Brand New"`. Split on `·` and take `[0]` as the condition; the rest is per-listing item-specifics (size, model, capacity, etc.).
- **Result count uses "X,XXX+ results" suffix for counts above 10,000**: `"18,000+ results for iphone 12"` (note the `+`). Parse the leading integer; surface a `countIsApproximate: true` flag when `+` is present.
- **Shipping ZIP is set by proxy IP unless overridden.** During testing the displayed ZIP was `37918` (Tennessee) — eBay's "Shipping to <ZIP>" header. The displayed delivery costs (`+$7.38 delivery`) are calculated against this ZIP. Override with `&_stpos=<ZIP>`; useful when the caller needs delivery cost from a specific origin.
- **`LH_Sold=1` alone is silently rewritten to the active-listings view.** Always pair with `LH_Complete=1`. The "2 filters applied" pill on the controls bar is your confirmation; the result count text does NOT contain the word "sold".
- **Time-left and auction-end datetimes do not render in the SRP card** for sold listings; for active auctions the row reads e.g. `"2d 4h"` (display-only). To get the precise ISO end-time, navigate to the item-detail page and read `.ux-timer__time` plus the `<meta itemprop="endDate">` if present.
- **Seller info is missing from most active-mode cards** — it surfaces reliably on Sold-mode cards (`buybackboss 99.6% positive (34.3K)`), and inconsistently on active cards. When `LH_TopRatedPlus=1` filter is applied, the seller-info row reliably surfaces with a "Top Rated Plus" badge before the username.
- **`data-listingid` ≠ `itemId`.** The `data-listingid="2500219655424533"` attribute on `<li>` is an internal listing-tracking ID (used for impression analytics), NOT the public `itemId` you'd use in `/itm/{id}`. **Always parse the itemId from the `/itm/(\d{8,})` portion of the anchor href.**
- **"Authenticity Guarantee" badge** appears as an attribute row only in supported categories (sneakers `_sacat=15709`, watches `_sacat=14324`, handbags `_sacat=169291`, trading cards >$250). Detect by the literal phrase `"Authenticity Guarantee"` in the rows.
- **Pagination via `_pgn` is reliable up to ~10,000 results** (`_ipg=240 × _pgn=42`). Beyond that, eBay caps and silently re-renders page 1. For exhaustive enumeration, narrow the query (price band or date filter) instead.
- **`_ipg` only accepts `60`, `120`, `240`** — any other integer is silently coerced to 60.
- **The category breadcrumbs in the left rail include a long tail of "related-but-not-selected" leaves**, not just the active path. The selected leaf has `aria-current="page"` or a `selected` class on its `<li>`. Don't naïvely emit the whole list as the active breadcrumbs.
- **`Cookie consent` modal** sometimes appears on the first page-load and obstructs the lower half of the SRP. eBay does not block scraping if it's not dismissed, but if your DOM extraction misses listings on iter 1 and `hasSCard: false`, dismiss it via `.gdpr-banner__close` and re-snapshot.
- **Honest gap: sold-date per card.** During this skill's iteration I did not isolate a stable selector for the per-card "Sold on <date>" caption — the value did not surface in `.s-card__attribute-row` or `.s-card__footer--row` rows for any of the iphone-12 sold cards I inspected. The per-item detail page (`/itm/{id}`) exposes a `Sold on <date>` element under `.x-item-sold-history`; that's the reliable fallback when callers require sold dates. A future agent should add `.s-card__caption`, `.s-card__caption--signal`, and `.s-card__signal` to the row-extraction set and re-test.
