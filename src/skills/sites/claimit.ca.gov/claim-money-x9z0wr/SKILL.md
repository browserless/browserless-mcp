# California Unclaimed Property Search

## Purpose

Search the California State Controller's Office "Claim It California" database (`claimit.ca.gov`) to find out whether a person or business is owed unclaimed money/property held by the State, and return the matching records with holder, location, dollar amount, NAUPA property type, and whether each record is claimable online. This skill is **read-only**: it performs the free name search and reads the results table only. It deliberately stops before filing a claim — the claim-filing wizard demands an SSN/ID and other personal identifiers and is gated by a Cloudflare Turnstile challenge, neither of which should be automated.

## When to Use

- Checking if a given individual or business name has unclaimed property in California ("is the State holding money for me?").
- Enumerating all property records tied to a name, with amounts, holders, and property IDs.
- Determining whether a found property can be claimed online now vs. must be recovered by contacting the holding business before a deadline.
- Bulk/periodic monitoring of a name across the California unclaimed-property roll.

## Workflow

The site is an Angular single-page app backed by a JSON API at `https://claimit.ca.gov/SWS/properties`. **The API is not usable standalone** (see Gotchas — naive calls return `400 swsError`, the real call rides Angular's fetch backend bound at bootstrap, and the file-claim path is Turnstile-gated), so the recommended and only reliable method is driving `browserless_agent`. The search itself does **not** require a proxy or extra stealth — a plain `browserless_agent` session reaches it cleanly. Keep the whole flow (goto → snapshot → type → click → wait → extract) in one `browserless_agent` call's `commands` array so the session persists across the re-render.

1. **Open the homepage**: `goto` `https://claimit.ca.gov/` (`waitUntil: "load"`). The hero section contains an inline search form.

2. **Snapshot to get live element refs**: run `snapshot`. The homepage form exposes:
   - `textbox: Last or Business Name` (required)
   - `textbox: First Name (Optional)`
   - `button: SEARCH`

   **Re-snapshot before every interaction.** Refs are Angular-generated and change on each render; they go stale immediately after any search re-renders the page.

3. **Fill and submit**: `type` `"Nguyen"` into the Last/Business-Name field (optionally the first-name field), then `click` the SEARCH control. The app performs a full document navigation to `https://claimit.ca.gov/app/claim-search`.

4. **Wait for results**: `waitForTimeout` 4000 ms (the results table is rendered after the `/SWS/properties` round-trip; there is no instant DOM).

5. **Read the count and rows**: pull `text` of `body` (or an `evaluate` that reads the grid). Look for `Your search returned N unclaimed properties.` Then extract the results table. Columns, in order: **Select an Action, Name, Co-Owner, Holder Name, Address, City, State, Zip, Amount, Property ID, Property Indicator**. Each row's "Select an Action" cell is either a `CLAIM` + `SHARE` button pair (claimable) or an `INFO` badge (not yet claimable).

6. **Refine if needed** (advanced form): the `/app/claim-search` page itself has a fuller form with extra filters — `City`, `Zip Code`, and `Property ID` in addition to Last/First name. Use these to narrow results, especially because the result set is **hard-capped at 1000** (e.g. "Garcia"/"Smith" both return exactly 1000). A `Property ID` alone is sufficient to look up a single record (leave the name blank).

7. **Paginate** if reading beyond the first page: a `Display:` selector offers 20/40/80 results per page, and a pager exposes up to 50 pages. Change page size first to minimize page turns.

8. **STOP.** Do not click `Continue To File Claim`. That begins the claims wizard which requires personal identifiers and triggers a Cloudflare Turnstile checkbox ("Please check the box below to continue"). Filing is out of scope for this read-only skill.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **Result set is capped at 1000.** Common names return exactly `1000` and the count does not reflect the true total. Always narrow with `City` / `Zip Code` on the `/app/claim-search` advanced form when you need completeness.
- **Element refs are volatile.** It is an Angular SPA; every search re-renders the results page and invalidates prior snapshot refs. Re-run `snapshot` and re-resolve `Last or Business Name` / `SEARCH` refs before each new search. Reusing a stale ref silently no-ops (the page keeps showing the previous result set) — a frequent failure mode.
- **Home → results is a real navigation, not just a route change.** Submitting from the homepage navigates the document to `/app/claim-search` and wipes any injected page state.
- **Two distinct row outcomes:**
  - _Claimable_ — row has `CLAIM` and `SHARE` buttons, a concrete `Amount` (e.g. `$67.24`), and a NAUPA `Property Indicator` (e.g. `CREDIT BAL - ACCTS RECEIVABLE`, `ESCROW ACCOUNTS`, `ACCOUNTS PAYABLE`, `REFUNDS DUE`, `UNREDEEMED GIFT CERTIFICATE`). This is "owed and claimable online."
  - _Not yet claimable_ — no CLAIM button; the action cell shows an `INFO` badge reading `Property is being transferred to the State Controller's Office.` or `Property not yet received by the State. Contact the business before MM/DD/YYYY.` `Amount` for these is often masked as `UNDER $100`. These must be recovered by contacting the holder business before the listed deadline, not via this site.
- **`Amount` is sometimes masked.** The SCO does not disclose the exact value of in-process/transferring property; expect literal `UNDER $100` strings alongside exact-dollar values. Treat `Amount` as a string, not a number.
- **No exact `claimable` flag in the API text** — derive it from presence of the CLAIM button / absence of an "INFO ... transferred/not yet received" indicator in the action cell.
- **Zero-result shape:** `Your search returned 0 unclaimed properties.` plus a table reading `No properties to display.`
- **The JSON API is a dead end for standalone use.** Endpoints `https://claimit.ca.gov/SWS/properties` and `/SWS/app/properties` exist, but: a naive `GET /SWS/properties?lastName=...` returns `{"status":500,...,"swsError":"swsError"}` with HTTP 400; the real request is issued by Angular's HttpClient fetch backend, which captures the native `fetch` reference at app bootstrap, so a `fetch`/`XMLHttpRequest` hook injected after page load never sees it and cannot be replayed. Don't waste time trying to script the API directly — drive the UI.
- **Anti-bot is on the _filing_ path, not search.** The search completed on a bare `browserless_agent` session (no proxy, no extra stealth). The homepage embeds Cloudflare Turnstile (sitekey `0x4AAAAAABagPdNG6AfwmwOU`) and ThreatMetrix device fingerprinting (`*.online-metrix.net`), but these gate `Continue To File Claim`, not the property search. If a future change adds friction to search, escalate to a residential proxy (`proxy: { proxy: "residential" }`) and, for the Turnstile, a `solve { type: "cloudflare" }` command.
- **Site served via CloudFront/S3** with a strict CSP; the SPA shell is tiny (`<sws-root>`) and all content is client-rendered, so a plain HTTP fetch / `browserless_function` of the bare URL returns only the bootstrap HTML — you must render with `browserless_agent` (a real browser) to see any property data.
