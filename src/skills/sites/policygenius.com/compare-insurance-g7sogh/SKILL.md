# Policygenius Insurance Comparison

## Purpose

Given a product intent (life, auto, home, renters, disability), a free-form
policy description, a carrier name, or a Policygenius product URL — return the
matching Policygenius-reviewed carriers as structured JSON: name, logo,
canonical review URL, Policygenius rating (decimal stars), pros / cons, AM Best
financial-strength rating, J.D. Power score, NAIC complaint index, "Best for"
editorial tag, and last-reviewed date. Read-only — never click `Apply`,
`Continue`, `Get a quote`, or any funnel CTA, and never submit a real applicant
profile.

This skill returns Policygenius's **editorial** comparison data (carrier reviews

- best-of rankings). It does **not** return live quote pricing — Policygenius's
  quote funnel is gated behind a multi-step questionnaire that requires real PII
  (SSN-region, date-of-birth, contact info) AND is explicitly robots-disallowed
  (see Gotchas).

## When to Use

- Building a side-by-side carrier comparison for one insurance product
  ("compare term life carriers", "renters in Chicago", "long-term disability").
- Resolving a single carrier name to its Policygenius review record
  ("Lemonade renters", "Haven Life term", "Amica auto").
- Pulling editorial "Best for X" rankings (best for poor credit, best for young
  adults, best customer satisfaction, best bundling, …).
- Enriching a downstream pricing or quote-aggregation flow with Policygenius's
  rating + pros/cons context.

**Not for**: live premium quotes, binding policies, or any flow that requires
submitting applicant demographics. Those are out of scope by design — see
Gotchas.

## Workflow

The optimal path is **direct HTTP fetch of Policygenius's editorial pages** —
they are static, server-rendered HTML with JSON-LD `Product`/`Review` and
`InsuranceAgency` schema blocks for every reviewed carrier. No anti-bot, no
JavaScript-rendering required, no session needed. Use `a direct HTTP fetch <url>` (or any
plain HTTPS client) — a Browserbase **session** is only required for the
fallback path below.

### 1. Resolve the input to a product + (optional) carrier slug

| Input shape                                          | → Resolution                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Full `/{product}-insurance/reviews/{carrier}/` URL   | Skip to step 3 (carrier detail).                                               |
| Full `/{product}-insurance/best-…/` URL              | Skip to step 4 (best-of list).                                                 |
| Product intent ("term life", "homeowners", …)        | Map to one of the product slugs below.                                         |
| Free-form description                                | Extract product + sub-product + state/city; map to product slug + best-of URL. |
| Carrier name ("Lemonade renters", "Haven Life term") | Map to `/{product}-insurance/reviews/{kebab-case-name}/`. Confirm via step 2.  |

**Product-slug table** (the `{product}` URL fragment):

| Intent                              | Product slug           | Reviews coverage       |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Term / Whole / UL / No-medical Life | `life-insurance`       | Full (~30 carriers)    |
| Auto / Car                          | `auto-insurance`       | Full (~30 carriers)    |
| Homeowners / Condo                  | `homeowners-insurance` | Full (~30 carriers)    |
| Renters                             | `renters-insurance`    | Full (~10 carriers)    |
| Long-term Disability                | `disability-insurance` | Limited (6 carriers)   |
| Pet (dog/cat)                       | `pet-insurance`        | **None** — see Gotchas |
| Health                              | `health-insurance`     | **None** — see Gotchas |
| Travel                              | `travel-insurance`     | **None** — see Gotchas |

### 2. Enumerate carriers for a product

Two equivalent discovery surfaces; prefer (a) for the simple list, (b) for a
ranked list with editorial "Best for X" tags:

**(a) Carrier review index** — every reviewed carrier slug for that product:

```
GET https://www.policygenius.com/{product}/reviews/
```

Carrier slugs appear as `href="/{product}/reviews/{slug}/"`. Extract with:

```
/{product}/reviews/([a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]+)/
```

Drop the synthetic slug `methodology` and any `{a}-vs-{b}` head-to-head slugs.

> ⚠️ The homeowners review index is >1 MB and **exceeds a direct HTTP fetch's 1 MB body
> cap** (server returns: `502 The response body exceeded the maximum allowed
size of 1MB. Use a browser session to handle large responses.`). Two
> workarounds: (i) enumerate via the sitemap at
> `https://www.policygenius.com/sitemap-0.xml` (~3 k URLs, 385 KB — fits) and
> filter for the `/{product}/reviews/{slug}/` shape; or (ii) drive a real
> Browserbase session for that one page. The auto / life / renters / disability
> indexes fit under the cap and need no workaround.

**(b) National best-of page** — ranked list + per-carrier "Best for X" callout:

| Product            | Canonical national best-of URL                                                |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Auto               | `/auto-insurance/best-car-insurance-companies/`                               |
| Life (umbrella)    | `/life-insurance/best-life-insurance-companies/`                              |
| Life (term)        | `/life-insurance/best-term-life-insurance-companies/`                         |
| Life (whole)       | `/life-insurance/best-whole-life-insurance-companies/`                        |
| Life (no-med-exam) | `/life-insurance/no-medical-exam-life-insurance/`                             |
| Homeowners         | `/homeowners-insurance/best-homeowners-insurance-companies/`                  |
| Disability (LTD)   | `/disability-insurance/best-disability-insurance-companies/`                  |
| Renters (national) | Not published. Use the renters review index (step 2a) + city pages (step 2c). |

Each best-of page embeds **multiple `<script type="application/ld+json">`
blocks**: one `Article` wrapper plus one `InsuranceAgency` per ranked carrier
(name, logo URL, canonical review URL). Editorial "Best for X" tags live in
sibling `<h2>`/`<h3>` headings of the shape:

```
<h2>1. Best overall coverage: Openly</h2>
<h2>2. Best for homeowners with poor credit: Travelers</h2>
```

Match with: `^(\d+)\.\s*Best\s+([^:]+):\s*(.+)$` to split rank, category,
carrier.

**(c) Region best-of** — state or city scoped:

| Product      | Pattern                                                           |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Auto state   | `/auto-insurance/best-car-insurance-in-{state-name-lower}/`       |
| Auto city    | `/auto-insurance/best-car-insurance-in-{city-fl}/` (Naples FL, …) |
| Homeowners   | `/homeowners-insurance/{state-name-lower}/best-companies/`        |
| Renters city | `/renters-insurance/best-renters-insurance-in-{city-lower}/`      |

State / city slugs are `lower-kebab-case`; some auto-city slugs append the
state abbreviation (`naples-fl`, `aurora-co`). Cross-check existence against
the sitemap before fetching. **A 404 returns a 41,008-byte branded
not-found page, not an HTTP 404 status from Policygenius's CDN** — but the
a direct HTTP fetch response **does** carry the correct upstream 404 statusCode. Check
`statusCode === 200` before parsing.

### 3. Pull a single carrier's detail page

```
GET https://www.policygenius.com/{product}/reviews/{carrier-slug}/
```

Each page has **exactly one** `<script type="application/ld+json">` block —
parse it as JSON and pull from the top-level / `@graph[0]` object:

| Field                   | JSON-LD path                                         |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Carrier full name       | `name` (strip the trailing " – Policygenius" suffix) |
| Policygenius rating     | `review.reviewRating.ratingValue` (decimal, 1–5)     |
| Best-rating denominator | `review.reviewRating.bestRating` (always `"5"`)      |
| Pros                    | `review.positiveNotes.itemListElement[].name`        |
| Cons                    | `review.negativeNotes.itemListElement[].name`        |
| Last-reviewed date      | `review.dateModified` (ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`)             |
| First-published date    | `review.datePublished`                               |
| Review author           | `review.author.name`                                 |
| Canonical review URL    | `url`                                                |
| Description blurb       | `description`                                        |

Logo URLs live in the `InsuranceAgency` schema blocks on the parent **best-of**
page, not on the carrier's own review page. To get a logo: hit the matching
best-of page and look up the carrier's `image.url` (always a
`https://images.ctfassets.net/3uw9cov4u60w/...` Contentful URL — that prefix is
a stable identifier of "Policygenius-CMS-hosted logo").

**Body-prose extraction** — the following fields are **not** in JSON-LD and must
be regex-pulled from the rendered prose. Treat all as best-effort; surface
`null` when absent:

| Field                     | Regex (case-insensitive, first match)                                                     |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AM Best rating            | `AM Best[^.]*?\b(A\+\+?                                                                   | A\+? | A-  | B\+\+? | B\+? | B-  | C\+\+? | C\+? | C-)\b` |
| J.D. Power score (0–1000) | `J\.?D\.? Power[^.]*?\b([5-9][0-9]{2})\b`                                                 |
| NAIC complaint index      | `(?:NAIC\|complaint index)[^.]*?\b([0-9]+\.[0-9]{1,2})\b`                                 |
| Money-back / free-look    | `(?:money-back\|free[ -]look)[^.]*?\b(\d{1,3})\s*(?:day\|days)\b`                         |
| Application time          | `application[^.]*?\b(\d{1,3})\s*(?:minute\|minutes\|hour\|hours\|day\|days)\b`            |
| Medical exam required     | Presence of "no medical exam" → `false`; "requires a medical exam" → `true`; else `null`. |

### 4. Editorial "Best for X" extraction (when serving a ranked comparison)

On a best-of page, walk DOM-order through `h2`/`h3` headings matching
`/^\d+\.\s*Best\s+([^:]+):\s*(.+?)$/`. The carrier name in the heading is the
`InsuranceAgency.name` (without the `~~~Insurance~~~` suffix some agencies
carry) — fuzzy-match to the JSON-LD blocks on the same page to resolve the
canonical review URL + logo.

### 5. Affiliate CTAs — capture, do not follow

Anchors with link text matching `/^(Apply|Continue|Get (a )?quote|Compare
quotes|See rates|Start saving)/i` are Policygenius's underwriter-affiliate
funnel entry points. Their `href` values point either at `/life-insurance/start`,
`/auto-insurance/quotes/`, `/homeowners-insurance/quotes/`,
`/life-insurance/quotes/`, or at an external partner domain.

**Emit them as `apply_url` on the carrier record with `apply_url_is_affiliate:
true`, but do NOT follow the redirect** — the destination is the funnel form
that this skill is forbidden from submitting, and the link is robots-disallowed
(see Gotchas).

### 6. Compose the response

Merge the per-carrier records pulled in step 3 with the editorial best-of tags
from step 4 and the logos / canonical-review-URLs from the `InsuranceAgency`
blocks. Sort by `Policygenius_rating` descending unless the caller requested
otherwise.

### Browser fallback (only when the static-HTML path fails)

The static path fails only in two known cases: (a) the homeowners review index
exceeds the 1 MB body cap, and (b) one or more individual carrier
pages temporarily serve from a cold edge cache and return partial HTML. Both
recover by driving a real browser via `browserless_agent`. Load the page and
parse the carrier slugs / JSON-LD **in-page** with `evaluate` (never ship the
raw multi-hundred-KB HTML back — that just re-hits a size limit):

```jsonc
// browserless_agent — all steps in one commands array (session persists, keyed by proxy).
// Add proxy: { "proxy": "residential", "proxyCountry": "us" } only for a burst
// of >20 fetches or when bare requests start truncating (see note below).
{
  "commands": [
    {
      "method": "goto",
      "params": {
        "url": "https://www.policygenius.com/{product}/reviews/",
        "waitUntil": "load",
        "timeout": 45000,
      },
    },
    {
      "method": "evaluate",
      "params": {
        "content": "(()=>{ const slugs=[...document.querySelectorAll('a[href]')].map(a=>a.getAttribute('href')).map(h=>(h.match(/\\/[a-z-]+\\/reviews\\/([a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]+)\\//)||[])[1]).filter(Boolean).filter(s=>s!=='methodology'&&!s.includes('-vs-')); return JSON.stringify([...new Set(slugs)]); })()",
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

The `evaluate` result comes back under `.value`. For a single carrier page,
swap the `goto` URL for `/{product}/reviews/{carrier-slug}/` and have the
`evaluate` return the parsed JSON-LD (`JSON.stringify` the projected fields).

A stealth + residential-proxy session is recommended (not required) — plain
sessions worked in our probes but Policygenius is fronted by Fastly + Varnish
and starts soft-throttling at ~10 req/min from a single IP. Add the residential
`proxy` arg (repeat it on every call — each `browserless_agent` invocation is a
fresh ephemeral session) when you expect to fetch >20 pages in a burst, or when
a bare request starts returning truncated bodies. There is no session-release
step — nothing to release; the session persists across calls (keyed by
`proxy`), so keeping the whole warm-up → nav → extract flow inside one
`commands` array just saves round-trips and avoids accidentally dropping that
config. **Never** drive the
browser into a quote funnel, even with a proxy'd session — see Gotchas.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **The quote funnel is robots-disallowed AND requires real PII — never enter
  it.** Policygenius's `/robots.txt` explicitly `Disallow`s every quote /
  application / estimation path:
  `/life-insurance/quotes/`, `/life-insurance/application`,
  `/life-insurance/estimation`, `/life-insurance/comparison`,
  `/life-insurance/start`, `/homeowners-insurance/quotes/`,
  `/auto-insurance/quotes/`, `/wills/create/`, plus all `*/exit-survey/*` and
  `*/health/` subpaths. The funnel pages themselves are full SPAs that require
  date-of-birth, SSN-region, ZIP, vehicle VIN (auto), or home address (home)
  before yielding any pricing — none of which this skill is permitted to submit.
  If a caller asks for "live quotes", return a stub:
  `{ "success": false, "reason": "quote_funnel_requires_pii_and_is_robots_disallowed" }`.

- **a direct HTTP fetch has a 1 MB body cap.** The homeowners review index
  (`/homeowners-insurance/reviews/`) returned the literal upstream string
  `502 The response body exceeded the maximum allowed size of 1MB. Use a
browser session to handle large responses.` Workaround: enumerate carrier
  slugs from `https://www.policygenius.com/sitemap-0.xml` (385 KB, fits)
  instead, or fall through to a Browserbase session for that one page. Auto,
  life, renters, and disability indexes all fit under the cap.

- **Pet, health, and travel insurance have no carrier-review pages.**
  `/pet-insurance/`, `/health-insurance/`, and `/travel-insurance/` are
  editorial article landing pages with **zero** `InsuranceAgency` schema blocks
  and no `/reviews/{slug}/` subpaths in the sitemap. Pet insurance is delegated
  to MarketWatch's pet guide (link in the page body); Policygenius does not
  underwrite or compare pet/health/travel carriers directly. The skill must
  return `{ "success": false, "reason": "product_not_covered", "product":
"pet|health|travel" }` for these three verticals — do NOT attempt to scrape
  the body prose into a fake carrier list.

- **Carrier review pages have exactly one JSON-LD block; best-of pages have
  10–15.** A best-of page contains: one `Article` (the wrapper), zero or one
  `FAQPage`, one or more `ImageObject`, and one `InsuranceAgency` per ranked
  carrier. Parse every block — discard parse failures silently — and pick out
  the InsuranceAgency entries.

- **JSON-LD `InsuranceAgency.name` sometimes has trailing whitespace** (`"Openly
"`, `"Nationwide "`, `"Amica "`). Always `.trim()` before matching against
  the "Best for X: Carrier" heading text.

- **`<title>` is the source-of-truth for the page's editorial title, but it is
  appended with `" – Policygenius"`** (en-dash + space). Strip the suffix
  before emitting. The JSON-LD `name` field has the same suffix.

- **AM Best / J.D. Power / NAIC values are in body prose, not in JSON-LD.** The
  regexes in the Workflow table get the values right ~90 % of the time but will
  occasionally match the wrong number (e.g. an AM Best `A++` from a sentence
  about a _parent_ company rather than the reviewed carrier). For
  high-accuracy use cases, emit the matched substring's context window (±60
  chars) as a `_provenance` field so downstream callers can sanity-check.

- **`/{product}/{state}/best-companies/` is the homeowners state-best-of
  pattern; auto uses `/auto-insurance/best-car-insurance-in-{state}/` instead.**
  Two different conventions in the same site. Renters uses city-not-state
  slugs (`/renters-insurance/best-renters-insurance-in-{city}/`). When in
  doubt, query the sitemap.

- **A 404 from Policygenius returns a 41,008-byte branded "page not found"
  page**, not a small error blob. The HTTP statusCode is correctly 404 in the
  a direct HTTP fetch response envelope — check `statusCode === 200` before parsing,
  don't rely on body length.

- **Sub-product life URLs are mostly distinct pages, but `no-medical-exam`
  lives at `/life-insurance/no-medical-exam-life-insurance/`** — not at
  `/life-insurance/best-no-medical-exam-life-insurance-companies/` (404). The
  product table in the Workflow lists the canonical URLs.

- **"Apply" / "Continue" / "Get a quote" anchors are affiliate URLs.** Capture
  the `href` but never fetch or navigate to them — both because (a) the
  destination is a robots-disallowed funnel and (b) following affiliate links
  artificially inflates Policygenius's referral metrics. Emit them with
  `apply_url_is_affiliate: true` so downstream consumers can choose whether to
  surface them.

- **Some reviewed carriers are no longer accepting applications** (e.g. Haven
  Life as of 2024-01-03 per its review's `dateModified`). The carrier review
  still loads, with positive/negative notes intact, but there is no "Apply"
  CTA. Surface this as `accepting_applications: false` when the page title or
  H1 contains the phrase "no longer accepting applications".

- **`review.dateModified` is the editorial-review date, not the rating-as-of
  date.** Some carrier reviews go 12+ months between `dateModified` updates
  while their AM Best / J.D. Power values change quarterly. Treat the JSON-LD
  rating as "Policygenius's view at last editorial review" — flag stale records
  (`dateModified > 18 months ago`) in the response.

- **Logo URLs are Contentful-hosted** with a stable prefix
  (`https://images.ctfassets.net/3uw9cov4u60w/...`). The path component
  contains a Contentful asset ID + filename — both URL-safe to embed in
  downstream JSON, no signed-URL expiry to worry about.

## Expected Output

Five distinct outcome shapes. All return `success: true` except the two stub
shapes (`product_not_covered`, `quote_funnel_requires_pii_and_is_robots_disallowed`).
