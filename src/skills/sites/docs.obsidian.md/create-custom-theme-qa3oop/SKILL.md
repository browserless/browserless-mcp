# Create a Custom Obsidian Theme

## Purpose

Return the complete, ordered, authoritative procedure for building a custom **Obsidian app theme**, sourced from the Obsidian Developer Documentation (`docs.obsidian.md`): the required files, the `manifest.json` schema, how styling is done through built-in CSS variables (light/dark/`:root`), how to embed assets offline, how to automate GitHub releases, and how to submit to the community directory. Read-only — this skill only reads documentation; it never edits a vault, submits a theme, or drives the Obsidian app itself.

`docs.obsidian.md` is an **Obsidian Publish** site (a JS-rendered SPA). Its page content is served as **raw markdown** from a public, unauthenticated Publish access API, so the fastest and most reliable path is to `fetch` the markdown directly rather than render the SPA in a browser.

## When to Use

- A user asks "how do I create / build / make a theme for Obsidian?" and wants a step-by-step answer.
- An agent needs the canonical `manifest.json` fields for a theme, or the exact CSS-variable override pattern (`body` vs `.theme-light`/`.theme-dark` vs `:root`).
- Bootstrapping or scaffolding an Obsidian theme repo, wiring up the GitHub Actions release workflow, or preparing a community-directory submission.
- Any time you'd otherwise scrape the rendered docs pages — the markdown API is faster, cheaper, and structurally cleaner.

## Workflow

The site is a thin Obsidian Publish SPA. Every doc page is fetchable as raw markdown from the Publish access API — **no auth, no cookies, no anti-bot, no residential proxy required** (verified with a plain HTTP GET, HTTP 200). Lead with the fetch path.

Because the Publish access + options endpoints are a same-origin JSON API on `publish-01.obsidian.md`, the reliable way to reach them from Browserless is `browserless_function`: `page.goto('https://publish-01.obsidian.md/')` first (a bare `fetch` has no egress until the page is navigated), then `page.evaluate` a same-origin `fetch`. The raw `curl`/HTTP examples below are canonical from any unrestricted client; route them through `browserless_function` only under restricted egress.

**Site UID (stable):** `caa27d6312fe5c26ebc657cc609543be`
**Raw-markdown endpoint:** `https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/<UID>/<PATH>.md`

### 1. (Optional) Discover the page tree

The full navigation tree + ordering lives in the site options blob:

```
GET https://publish-01.obsidian.md/options/caa27d6312fe5c26ebc657cc609543be
```

Its `navigationOrdering[]` array lists explicitly-ordered pages; unordered pages fall back to alphabetical. The app-theme pages live under `Themes/App themes/` (distinct from `Themes/Obsidian Publish themes/`, which is a different topic).

### 2. Fetch the theme docs as markdown

Spaces in the path are **URL-encoded as `%20`** (the access API rejects raw spaces with `400 url must match format "uri"`). Fetch these pages:

| Page                                   | Path (append `.md`, URL-encode spaces)                     |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Build a theme (main tutorial)          | `Themes/App themes/Build a theme`                          |
| Theme guidelines                       | `Themes/App themes/Theme guidelines`                       |
| Embed fonts and images in your theme   | `Themes/App themes/Embed fonts and images in your theme`   |
| Release your theme with GitHub Actions | `Themes/App themes/Release your theme with GitHub Actions` |
| Submit your theme                      | `Themes/App themes/Submit your theme`                      |
| Manifest schema                        | `Reference/Manifest`                                       |
| About styling                          | `Reference/CSS variables/About styling`                    |
| CSS variables (400+ vars)              | `Reference/CSS variables/CSS variables`                    |

```
UID=caa27d6312fe5c26ebc657cc609543be
GET https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/$UID/Themes/App%20themes/Build%20a%20theme.md
# The JSON envelope's `content` field is the raw markdown. A non-existent
# page returns HTTP 200 with body "## Not Found\n\nFile X.md does not exist."
```

Under restricted egress, run this via `browserless_function` (same-origin, so navigate to the API origin first):

```json
{
  "code": "export default async function ({ page }) { await page.goto('https://publish-01.obsidian.md/'); const uid='caa27d6312fe5c26ebc657cc609543be'; const out = await page.evaluate(async (uid) => { const r = await fetch(`https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/${uid}/Themes/App%20themes/Build%20a%20theme.md`); return r.json(); }, uid); return out.content; }"
}
```

### 3. Synthesize the theme-creation procedure

The authoritative flow the docs describe:

1. **Download the sample theme** into your vault's themes folder: `cd <vault>/.obsidian/themes` then `git clone https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-sample-theme.git "Sample Theme"`. (The repo is a GitHub _template_, so you can also "Use this template" to create your own.)
2. **Enable it** in Obsidian: **Settings → Appearance → Themes → Sample Theme**.
3. **Edit `manifest.json`** — set `name` to your theme's human-friendly display name, then rename the theme directory under `themes/` to **exactly match** `name`. Restart Obsidian after any `manifest.json` change.
4. **Style via CSS variables in `theme.css`** — Obsidian exposes 400+ CSS variables. Override:
   - theme-agnostic values (fonts, sizes) under `body { --font-text-theme: Georgia, serif; }`
   - color-scheme colors under `.theme-dark { --background-primary: #18004F; }` and `.theme-light { --background-primary: #ECE4FF; }`
   - variables that must reach every child element (often plugin/input vars) under `:root { --input-hover-border-color: red; }` — use sparingly.
     `theme.css` changes hot-reload without restarting Obsidian (unlike `manifest.json`).
5. **Discover which variable styles an element** via DevTools (`Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+I`): **Sources → top → obsidian.md → app.css** (scroll to top for the full variable list; search `"  --prefix"` with two leading spaces to find _definitions_), or use the element picker and read the **Styles** panel (e.g. `background-color: var(--ribbon-background)`).
6. **Keep assets local** — community themes may not load remote content. Embed fonts/images as base64 **data URLs**: `url("data:<MIME>;base64,<DATA>")`.
7. **Automate releases with GitHub Actions** — add `.github/workflows/release.yml` triggered on tag push, running `gh release create "$tag" --generate-notes --draft manifest.json theme.css`. Then `git tag -a x.y.z -m "x.y.z" && git push origin x.y.z`, and publish the resulting draft release.
8. **Submit to the community directory** — ensure the repo root has `README.md`, `LICENSE`, a screenshot (~512×288 px), and `manifest.json`; create a GitHub release whose tag matches `manifest.json`'s `version`; then at [community.obsidian.md](https://community.obsidian.md) sign in, link GitHub, **Themes → New theme**, enter the repo URL, agree to the Developer policies, and **Submit**.

### 4. `manifest.json` fields (theme)

From `Reference/Manifest`. A theme manifest uses only the **shared** properties (the `description`/`id`/`isDesktopOnly` fields are **plugin-only** and do not apply to themes):

| Field           | Required | Notes                                                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`          | yes      | Display name; must exactly match the theme's directory name. Cannot be changed after submission. Basic-Latin only, no emoji/special chars (hyphen/`+`/parens allowed). |
| `version`       | yes      | Semantic Versioning, strictly `x.y.z`. The release tag must equal this.                                                                                                |
| `author`        | yes      | Author name.                                                                                                                                                           |
| `minAppVersion` | yes      | Minimum supported Obsidian version.                                                                                                                                    |
| `authorUrl`     | no       | Author website.                                                                                                                                                        |
| `fundingUrl`    | no       | String or object of funding links.                                                                                                                                     |

### Browser fallback

If the markdown API is ever unreachable, drive the rendered SPA with `browserless_agent`:

```json
{
  "commands": [
    {
      "method": "goto",
      "params": {
        "url": "https://docs.obsidian.md/Themes/App+themes/Build+a+theme",
        "waitUntil": "load",
        "timeout": 45000
      }
    },
    { "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 3000 } },
    { "method": "text", "params": { "selector": "body" } }
  ]
}
```

The `waitForTimeout` covers the SPA's ~2-3s post-load hydration; read the text only AFTER the wait. Note the rendered-URL form uses **`+` for spaces** (e.g. `/Themes/App+themes/Build+a+theme`), unlike the `%20` of the raw access API. A plain (non-proxied) session renders these pages fine; the validation run over a residential proxy also succeeded.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **It's an Obsidian Publish SPA, not static HTML.** A plain fetch of `https://docs.obsidian.md/<page>` returns a ~2.7 KB JS shell, not the article. The real content is the `content` field of `https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/<UID>/<PATH>.md`.
- **Two different URL encodings.** The raw access API needs **`%20`** for spaces and returns `400 url must match format "uri"` on raw spaces. The rendered `docs.obsidian.md` URLs use **`+`** for spaces. Don't mix them.
- **404s masquerade as 200.** A missing markdown page returns HTTP 200 with body `## Not Found\n\nFile <path>.md does not exist.` — check the body, not just the status. This is how the wrong path guesses (`Themes/Build a theme.md`) were ruled out; the real tree is `Themes/App themes/...`.
- **`navigationOrdering` is partial.** The options blob only lists explicitly-ordered pages (e.g. it omits several `Themes/App themes/` pages that clearly exist). Don't treat it as the complete file list — probe expected paths directly or read the rendered sidebar.
- **Reading the page text too early returns the preload shell.** During the browser run, snapshotting before hydration yielded only the inline `(function(){let t=localStorage.getItem('site-theme')...})` bootstrap script instead of article text. Always `goto` with `waitUntil: load` + a ~3000 ms `waitForTimeout` before extracting on the browser path.
- **No auth / no proxy needed for the markdown API.** Cloudflare fronts the site (the pre-run probe flagged `likelyNeedsProxies: true` for the homepage), but the Publish access + options endpoints returned 200 on a bare a direct HTTP fetch. `verified`/`proxies` are not required for the recommended fetch path.
- **`manifest.json` changes require an Obsidian restart; `theme.css` changes hot-reload.** Renaming the theme requires the directory name to exactly equal `manifest.json`'s `name`.
- **App themes ≠ Publish themes.** `Themes/App themes/` (this skill) covers the desktop/mobile app; `Themes/Obsidian Publish themes/` is a separate topic for styling published sites — don't conflate them.
- **Submission has two coupled requirements.** The community directory reads `manifest.json` at the default branch HEAD, but installs pull `manifest.json` + `theme.css` from the **GitHub release** whose tag matches the manifest `version`. Both the committed manifest and a matching-tag release must exist.
