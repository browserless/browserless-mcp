# BJA Find Funding Opportunities

## Purpose

Enumerate U.S. DOJ Bureau of Justice Assistance funding opportunities listed on `bja.ojp.gov` and return them as structured JSON. For each opportunity surface: title, opportunity ID (`O-BJA-YYYY-XXXXX`), status (open / closed), solicitation type (Competitive / Formula / Non-Competitive / etc.), primary topic + free-text tag list, posting date, closing date, Grants.gov deadline, JustGrants deadline, short description preview, eligible applicant types when parseable, detail-page URL on `bja.ojp.gov`, and the NOFO PDF URL on `ojp.gov`. Read-only — no application submitted.

## When to Use

- Daily / weekly polling for newly-posted BJA funding announcements.
- Topic-, keyword-, or applicant-type-scoped queries against the BJA catalog (e.g. "currently open drug-court opportunities for tribal governments").
- Bulk extraction of the BJA NOFO PDF index for a downstream PDF parser (which then resolves award_min / award_max / expected_number_of_awards / total_program_funding — those live only inside the PDF; see Site-Specific Gotchas).
- Comparing the open queue against past awards (`/funding/expired`) for trend analysis.

## Workflow

The BJA funding listing is a thin Drupal 10 view over a public JSON API at `https://bja.ojp.gov/funding-api/*`. No auth, no cookies, no anti-bot — verified during 2026-05-19 testing as a plain HTTP GET (no stealth, no residential proxy). From a client with normal egress just `curl`/`fetch` the endpoints directly; under restricted egress route via `browserless_function` (`page.goto('https://bja.ojp.gov/')` first, then `page.evaluate` a same-origin `fetch` of the `/funding-api/...` path — bare cross-origin fetch has no egress until the page is navigated). Lead with the JSON API; only fall back to the HTML cards when you need a filter dimension the API doesn't honor and you don't want to filter client-side. The browser is overkill — the entire skill can run in 2 HTTP requests.

### 1. Pick the right endpoint by status

| Requested status                          | Endpoint                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Today's row count                 |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `open` (currently accepting applications) | `GET https://bja.ojp.gov/funding-api/current_funding_data`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | ~7 (2026-05-19)                   |
| `closed` (no longer accepting)            | `GET https://bja.ojp.gov/funding-api/expired_funding_data`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 500 (server-side cap; see gotcha) |
| `forecasted`                              | **Not supported by BJA.** See gotchas — BJA does not publish a forecasted queue. The OJP-wide "anticipated" view does not include BJA-specific opportunities at a discoverable BJA URL. Return `{ "status": "forecasted", "items": [], "note": "BJA does not publish a forecasted/anticipated opportunity queue. /funding/expected, /funding/archive, /funding/forecasted, /funding/anticipated, /funding/upcoming all return 404. Closest substitute: subscribe to BJA's notification list or watch Grants.gov directly." }` and exit. |

Both supported endpoints return `200 OK` with `Content-Type: application/json` and an array of opportunity records. Filter query string parameters (`?search=`, `?form_topic=`, `?funding_category=`) are **silently ignored** by the API — see gotchas. Filter client-side after fetching.

### 2. Decode each record

API rows have these keys (lowercase; types as observed 2026-05-19):

```jsonc
{
  "origin_site": "BJA", // always "BJA"
  "title": "FY25 Byrne State Crisis Intervention Formula Program",
  "url": "https://bja.ojp.gov/funding/opportunities/o-bja-2025-172582",
  "field_closing_date": "2026-05-19T20:59:59", // ISO-8601, local-Eastern as Z-naive
  "field_grants_gov_deadline": "2026-05-12T23:59:59", // ISO-8601
  "field_app_justgrants_deadline": "2026-05-19T20:59:59", // ISO-8601 (usually == closing_date)
  "code_body": "", // always empty in observed runs
  "field_funding_type": "Formula", // Competitive | Competitive Discretionary | Formula | Continuation | Non-Competitive | Noncompetitive Discretionary
  "name": "Courts", // primary topic (see topic taxonomy below)
  "tags": "Crisis response, Formula NOFOs, Crisis intervention, Violent crime, ...", // comma-separated free-text tags
  "body": "Jmx0O3AmZ3Q7...", // **base64-encoded HTML preview, truncated** — see gotcha
}
```

To produce the requested output shape:

- **`grant_name`** = `title`
- **`opportunity_id`** = uppercase the last URL segment: `o-bja-2025-172582` → `O-BJA-2025-172582`.
- **`status`** = derived from which endpoint you called (`current_funding_data` → `open`, `expired_funding_data` → `closed`).
- **`solicitation_type`** = `field_funding_type` (string enum above).
- **`primary_topic`** = `name`.
- **`topic_tags`** = `tags.split(", ")` (comma + space). Free-text — includes program names, controlled topics, and ad-hoc descriptors mixed together.
- **`close_date`** = `field_closing_date` (this is the final hard application deadline = JustGrants deadline).
- **`grants_gov_deadline`** = `field_grants_gov_deadline` (SF-424 pre-submission, typically 7 days before `close_date`).
- **`justgrants_deadline`** = `field_app_justgrants_deadline`.
- **`description_preview`** = decode and strip HTML from `body`:
  ```js
  let body = Buffer.from(item.body, 'base64').toString('utf8');
  // Drupal double-encodes: &lt; → <, etc.
  body = body
    .replace(/&lt;/g, '<')
    .replace(/&gt;/g, '>')
    .replace(/&amp;/g, '&')
    .replace(/&quot;/g, '"')
    .replace(/&nbsp;/g, ' ');
  const description_preview = body
    .replace(/<[^>]+>/g, ' ')
    .replace(/\s+/g, ' ')
    .trim();
  ```
  **The decoded body is truncated to roughly 700–1500 chars and ends in `...`.** For the full description, fetch the NOFO PDF (out of scope for this skill).
- **`eligible_applicant_types`** = parse the `<ul>` block following `<strong>Eligible Applicants:</strong>` in the decoded `body`. The structure is two-level (top-level `Government Entities:` / `Nonprofits:` / `Other:` groupings, each containing leaf `<li>` items like `State governments`, `County governments`, `Native American Tribal governments (federally recognized)`). **This list is also truncated in many records** — the body cut-off can fall mid-`<ul>`. If you need a complete, verified applicant list, fall back to the NOFO PDF.
- **`detail_url`** = `url` (already canonical).
- **`nofo_pdf_url`** = derivable from the opportunity_id WITHOUT fetching the detail page:
  ```js
  const slug = item.url.split('/').pop(); // "o-bja-2025-172582"
  const pdfSlug = slug.replace(/^o-/, ''); // "bja-2025-172582"
  const nofo_pdf_url = `https://www.ojp.gov/funding/docs/${pdfSlug}.pdf`;
  ```
  Verified working pattern across all 7 currently-open opportunities (2026-05-19). The PDF is hosted on `www.ojp.gov`, not `bja.ojp.gov`. Older expired solicitations (FY2018 and earlier) often lack a NOFO PDF entirely — emit `null` and skip if the URL 404s.

### 3. Apply client-side filters

Because the API ignores filter params, do all filtering in your decode step:

| Filter dimension                | Source                            | Implementation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Keyword**                     | API `title` + decoded `body` text | `title.toLowerCase().includes(q) \|\| descriptionPreview.toLowerCase().includes(q) \|\| tags.toLowerCase().includes(q)`                                                                                                                         |
| **Status**                      | choice of endpoint                | covered in step 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Topic (controlled)**          | API `name` and/or `tags`          | exact-match against `name`, substring-match against `tags`. See observed taxonomy below.                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Eligible applicant type**     | decoded `body` `<ul>`             | match against the leaf strings extracted above. **Best-effort only** — body truncation makes this unreliable; surface a `"applicant_filter_confidence": "low"` flag when the body ends in `...` before the applicant list was fully enumerated. |
| **Close-after / close-before**  | API `field_closing_date`          | ISO date compare                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Award range (min / max USD)** | **NOT exposed on bja.ojp.gov**    | Surface `null` for award fields and skip this filter, OR delegate to a downstream NOFO-PDF parser (out of scope per this skill's contract).                                                                                                     |

**Observed topic taxonomy** (from the listing page's `<select name="form_topic">`, with Drupal taxonomy term IDs — useful only for the HTML fallback in step 4):

| term ID | label             |
| ------- | ----------------- |
| 65276   | Corrections       |
| 61066   | Courts            |
| 71001   | Drugs             |
| 61741   | Forensic sciences |
| 74921   | Hate crimes       |
| 63146   | Law enforcement   |
| 79401   | Mental health     |
| 88921   | Tribal justice    |
| 63326   | Violent crime     |

This is **narrower than the prompt's claimed BJA vocabulary** ("Officer Safety", "Justice Information Sharing", "Victim Services", etc.) — those labels do not appear in the filter UI. Topic-tags like "Officer safety and wellness" do appear inside the free-text `tags` field, so use substring matching on `tags` for topics outside the controlled list above.

### 4. Browser / HTML fallback (only if you need server-side filtering)

Skip this unless the client-side filter pass in step 3 is unworkable (e.g. you only want a count, not the records, and want to avoid downloading the whole catalog). The HTML listing **does** honor filter params via Drupal Views — but each card only exposes title + 3 dates (no topic, no tags, no body, no eligible applicants), so this loses ~80% of the structured data the API gives you. Cards are at `<article class="listing-item listing-item--funding_opportunity">` with selector pattern:

```
/funding/current?search=<urlenc>&form_topic=<termID>&funding_category=<Competitive|Formula|...>&sort_by=field_closing_date_value&sort_order=ASC&page=<N>
```

Or for closed: `/funding/expired?…` (same param set). Pagination uses `?page=N` zero-indexed, 25 cards per page. Per-card extraction regex from the listing HTML:

- detail URL: `<a href="(/funding/opportunities/[a-z0-9-]+)">`
- title: `<span class="field field--name-title[^"]*">([^<]+)</span>` inside that anchor
- close date: inside `field--name-field-closing-date` block → `<time datetime="([^"]+)"`
- grants.gov deadline: same pattern inside `field--name-field-grants-gov-deadline`
- justgrants deadline: same pattern inside `field--name-field-app-justgrants-deadline`

To enrich beyond those four fields from the HTML path, you have to fetch each detail page (`bja.ojp.gov/funding/opportunities/{slug}`) — which **still** does not expose award amounts or full applicant lists; it adds only `Opportunity ID`, `Solicitation Status`, `Fiscal Year`, `Posting Date`, `Solicitation Type`, and the NOFO PDF download link. **The API gives you strictly more, faster.** Use the HTML path only as a tie-breaker when the API path is unavailable.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **The API ignores filter query strings.** `?search=…`, `?form_topic=…`, `?funding_category=…` are accepted (200 OK) but the response is unchanged — verified by appending `?search=crisis&form_topic=61066` and still getting all 7 current items back. The HTML listing path (`/funding/current?search=…`) does honor these. The form's `action="/funding-api/current_funding_data"` is misleading — clicking submit on the rendered form actually reloads the HTML view with the params, not the JSON endpoint.
- **`forecasted` status does not exist on BJA.** Verified 2026-05-19: `/funding/forecasted`, `/funding/anticipated`, `/funding/upcoming`, `/funding/expected`, `/funding/archive` all return 404. `/funding-api/forecasted_funding_data`, `/funding-api/anticipated_funding_data`, `/funding-api/upcoming_funding_data` all return `200 OK` but with a zero-length body (Drupal's behavior for non-existent REST views). BJA only publishes "currently available" (`/funding/current`) and "past" (`/funding/expired`). Do not invent a forecasted result set; return an empty array with the note in step 1.
- **`/funding/expected` and `/funding/archive` from the prompt's input spec are wrong.** They return 404. The correct paths are `/funding/current` and `/funding/expired`. The prompt's "Past Funding" sidebar link confirms this: it points to `/funding/expired`.
- **The `body` field is base64-encoded AND HTML-entity-double-encoded AND truncated.** Decoding chain: `Buffer.from(body, 'base64').toString('utf8')` → `&lt;` → `<`, `&gt;` → `>`, `&amp;` → `&`, `&quot;` → `"`, `&nbsp;` → ` ` → strip remaining tags. Truncation cuts at ~700–1500 chars decoded and ends with literal `...`. **Eligible-applicants lists are often cut off mid-`<ul>`** — confidence on applicant-type filtering is low for any record whose body ends in `...`. The full description lives only in the NOFO PDF.
- **NOFO PDF URL is derivable, not surfaced.** The API does not include a `pdf_url` field. Construct: take the URL slug (`o-bja-2025-172582`), strip the leading `o-` (→ `bja-2025-172582`), and prefix with `https://www.ojp.gov/funding/docs/` and suffix with `.pdf`. The detail page also includes a `class="usa-button usa-button--big"` Download anchor pointing at the same URL — fetch the detail page only if you want to verify the PDF exists before emitting the URL.
- **Older (FY2018 and earlier) opportunities often lack a NOFO PDF.** The detail page for `bja-2018-13620` has no `field-opportunity-document` block — older records were imported from a legacy system that only carries title/status/dates/opportunity_id. Treat `nofo_pdf_url` as nullable.
- **`expired_funding_data` is capped at 500 rows.** The HTML view `/funding/expired` paginates over 49 pages × 25 cards = ~1225 historical records, but the JSON endpoint returns at most 500 (most-recent-first ordering). For deeper historical extraction, fall back to HTML pagination — `/funding/expired?page=0..48&sort_by=field_closing_date_value&sort_order=DESC`.
- **Award amounts, expected number of awards, and total program funding are NOT exposed on `bja.ojp.gov` at all.** Not in the API, not on the listing card, not on the detail page. They live exclusively inside the NOFO PDF body text (typically under headings like "Eligibility" → "Award Information" → "Award Amount" / "Number of Awards" / "Total Amount Available"). Any filter on `award_min` / `award_max` requires a NOFO PDF parser — explicitly out of scope per this skill's contract. Emit those fields as `null` and pass the PDF URL through.
- **`field_closing_date` is Eastern time but serialized as Z-naive.** Format is `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS` with no timezone suffix — the underlying value is Eastern (EST/EDT) as shown on the detail page ("8:59 pm Eastern"). The detail page's `<time datetime="...Z">` ISO attribute renders as Zulu but the displayed "Closing Date" reflects the local Eastern day. When comparing against a user-supplied `close_after` / `close_before`, treat the API value as `America/New_York`.
- **`name` (primary topic) is sometimes a default, not a true classification.** All 7 currently-open opportunities (2026-05-19) returned `"name": "Courts"` regardless of subject matter — including the "FY25 Rural Law Enforcement Violent Crime Reduction Initiative" which is clearly law-enforcement-primary, not courts. The `tags` field is far more reliable for topic classification — it carries 3–13 ordered facets per opportunity covering program name + topic areas + crime types. **Filter on `tags` (case-insensitive substring), not `name`, for any topic search.**
- **Topic taxonomy mismatch with prompt.** The prompt lists "Officer Safety and Wellness", "Substance Use", "Justice Information Sharing", "Victim Services", "Tribal" — but the listing page's `form_topic` `<select>` only exposes 9 controlled terms: Corrections, Courts, Drugs, Forensic sciences, Hate crimes, Law enforcement, Mental health, Tribal justice, Violent crime. The prompt's broader vocabulary appears to be BJA's editorial Program Areas (visible on `/program/{slug}` pages) rather than the funding-listing filter taxonomy. For prompts that reference an out-of-controlled-list topic, substring-match against `tags` instead of `name`.
- **`Solicitation Status` on the detail page is one of: `Open`, `Closed`, `Forecasted` (theoretically) — but in practice you'll only see `Open` and `Closed`.** No record observed during 2026-05-19 testing exposed a `Forecasted` solicitation status on its detail page.
- **No anti-bot, no auth, no rate-limit-evidence.** Site is fronted by Cloudflare + Drupal 10 + Varnish, but every endpoint above returned 200 OK from a plain HTTP GET with no proxies, no stealth, and no cookies. 8 sequential requests during testing produced no 429 / 403 / captcha. Still, keep ≤ 1 req/s sustained as a courtesy — the API is uncached (`X-Drupal-Dynamic-Cache: UNCACHEABLE`).
- **Field name surprise: `code_body` is always empty.** Don't try to parse it. The real description preview is in `body` (base64).
- **`origin_site` is hardcoded `"BJA"` in the BJA mini-site's API.** Other OJP bureaus (NIJ, OJJDP, OVC, COPS) likely host their own parallel `*.ojp.gov/funding-api/current_funding_data` endpoints with `origin_site` differing; this skill is scoped to BJA only.
