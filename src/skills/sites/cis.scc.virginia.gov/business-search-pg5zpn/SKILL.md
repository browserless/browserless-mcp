# Virginia SCC Business Entity Search

## Purpose

Search the Virginia State Corporation Commission Clerk's Information System
(CIS) business-entity registry by entity name (e.g. "smith ventures") and
return the matching entities — name, SCC entity ID, type, status, formation
date, and jurisdiction. Read-only; this skill never files, pays, or signs in.

**Status: candidate / blocked.** The full navigation path (cookie consent →
search form → field mapping → submit mechanics) is mapped and documented below,
but the search itself is gated by an invisible **reCAPTCHA v3 (enterprise,
action `submit`)** that scores automated browser sessions **0.0** every time.
The server validates the score server-side and refuses to run the query, so an
automated agent **cannot currently retrieve live results** from this site. The
sections below give the exact working flow up to the wall plus everything
learned about the wall, so a future agent (or one with a reCAPTCHA-solving
capability / score-passing fingerprint) doesn't have to re-discover it.

## When to Use

- Looking up a Virginia-registered business (LLC, corporation, LP, etc.) by
  name to get its SCC entity ID, status (Active/Terminated), and type.
- Verifying whether a business name is registered/available in Virginia.
- Any flow that would otherwise scrape `cis.scc.virginia.gov/EntitySearch`.

**Before relying on this skill, read the Site-Specific Gotchas — as of
2026-06-03 the reCAPTCHA v3 gate blocks all automated extraction.** Use it as a
navigation map, not a guaranteed data source. For bulk needs, prefer the SCC's
official bulk-data offering (see gotchas) over this gated UI.

## Workflow

`recommended_method: browser`. There is **no public JSON/REST API** and no
URL-deep-link that bypasses the search form — the entity search is a single
`POST /EntitySearch/Index` whose execution is gated server-side by a reCAPTCHA
v3 score. A `browserless_agent` session with a residential proxy is the only
viable surface, and even that is currently blocked at the reCAPTCHA gate.

Recommended call: `browserless_agent` with `proxy: { proxy: "residential" }`
(repeated on every call — the session persists across calls, keyed by `proxy`/`profile`, so a call that drops or changes the proxy lands in a different session), keeping the whole
flow (goto → accept cookies → fill → submit) in a single `commands` array so the
ASP.NET session cookie persists. Note: `browserless_agent`'s `solve` command
**cannot** clear this gate — reCAPTCHA **v3** is an invisible, server-scored
signal (not an interactive checkbox/widget), and it scores the automated Chrome
0.0 regardless of proxy/fingerprint. Proxy choice does **not** change the outcome
(see gotchas); a residential proxy is simply the most likely config to ever pass
if Google's scoring changes.

1. **Open the site and clear the cookie wall.** `goto` `https://cis.scc.virginia.gov/`
   with `browserless_agent`. Every first request 302-redirects to `/Cookie/CookieConsent`. A modal
   "Cookie Consent" dialog renders with **Accept** / **Reject** buttons. Click
   **Accept** (accessibility-tree button labeled `Accept`; it is the button
   whose text matches `/accept/i`). This sets the ASP.NET session cookie needed
   for everything downstream. Skipping it leaves you bouncing to
   `/Account/Login`.

2. **Go to the entity search page.** Navigate directly to
   `https://cis.scc.virginia.gov/EntitySearch/Index`. The page titled
   "BUSINESS ENTITY SEARCH" renders the form. (Do **not** use the quick search
   box on the home page — submitting from there redirects to `/Account/Login`.)

3. **Set the match logic (optional).** The "Select One" dropdown is
   `#BEFilingSearch_ddlSearchLogic` with values: `2` = Starts With (default),
   `3` = Exact Match, `7` = Contains. For a broad name search like
   "smith ventures", `7` (Contains) is the most inclusive; the default
   `2` (Starts With) matches names beginning with the term.

4. **Enter the entity name.** Fill `#BusinessSearch_Index_txtBusinessName` with
   the search term (e.g. `smith ventures`). The form has one input per search
   mode (Entity Name, Entity ID `#BusinessSearch_Index_txtBusinessID`, Filing
   Number, Principal Name, Registered Agent Name, Designee). Use exactly one.

5. **Submit.** Click `#btnSearch` (an `<input type="button" value="Search">`).
   Its jQuery click handler builds a `BusinessSearch` JSON object, then runs the
   reCAPTCHA gate (see step 6). **It is not a normal form submit** — pressing
   Enter or submitting the `<form>` directly does not trigger the real flow.

6. **The reCAPTCHA gate (the blocker).** On click the handler does:
   `grecaptcha.ready(() => grecaptcha.execute("6LdtxWcrAAAAAKvoAZZD9KSKaBAP4hxDtSyeI6rz", {action:'submit'}).then(token => $.ajax POST /GoogleCaptchaHelper/VerifyReCaptcha {recaptchaToken: token}))`.
   - If the AJAX response is `{success:true, score:<n>}` it calls
     `$.submitForm('/EntitySearch/Index', BusinessSearch)` which POSTs the
     search and renders the results grid.
   - If `{success:false}` it shows a SweetAlert popup **"Please try again. You
     may be a bot!"** and aborts — **no results**.
     On automated sessions `VerifyReCaptcha` always returns `{"success":false,"score":0}`,
     so step 7 is never reached.

7. **Extract results (only reachable if reCAPTCHA passes).** A successful search
   POST returns the results page with a results table/grid. Each row carries the
   entity name (a link to the entity detail page), SCC entity ID, entity type,
   and status. Iterate the rows, read each cell, and follow the entity-name link
   if formation date / jurisdiction are needed (not all columns are on the grid).
   Emit the JSON in Expected Output. **This step could not be validated because
   of the reCAPTCHA wall; the grid's exact column ids are unconfirmed.**

### If the wall ever lifts

The cheapest way to test whether automated search is possible _without_ burning
an LLM agent loop is to measure the score directly in page context after
loading `/EntitySearch/Index`:

```js
grecaptcha.ready(() =>
  grecaptcha
    .execute('6LdtxWcrAAAAAKvoAZZD9KSKaBAP4hxDtSyeI6rz', { action: 'submit' })
    .then((t) =>
      fetch('/GoogleCaptchaHelper/VerifyReCaptcha', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
          'X-Requested-With': 'XMLHttpRequest',
        },
        body: 'recaptchaToken=' + encodeURIComponent(t),
      })
        .then((r) => r.text())
        .then(console.log),
    ),
);
// Currently logs: {"success":false,"score":0}
```

If that ever returns `success:true`, proceed with step 5's normal `#btnSearch`
click and the results grid will render.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **reCAPTCHA v3 enterprise is a hard wall (confirmed 2026-06-03).** Site key
  `6LdtxWcrAAAAAKvoAZZD9KSKaBAP4hxDtSyeI6rz`, action `submit`, verified
  server-side at `POST /GoogleCaptchaHelper/VerifyReCaptcha`. Every automated
  browser session scores **exactly 0.0**. Tested four configurations — all
  scored 0: residential proxy, datacenter IP, a bare session, and a "warmed"
  session (click into the field, type slowly, scroll, dispatch mousemoves, 12 s
  dwell before `grecaptcha.execute`). Proxy/IP and
  fingerprint do **not** move the score; reCAPTCHA is detecting the CDP-driven
  Chrome itself. Without a passing score the search POST is refused.
- **A score-0 (failed) real submit redirects to a 403, not a friendly error.**
  When `#btnSearch` runs the genuine flow with a score-0 token, the server-side
  block on the `POST /EntitySearch/Index` form submission responds with a
  redirect to `https://www.scc.virginia.gov/web-policy/`, which renders
  **"Server Error / 403 - Forbidden: Access is denied."** (See screenshot 3.)
  Don't mistake this 403 page for the search being down — it is the bot block.
- **Bypassing the client gate doesn't help — the server enforces it too.**
  Calling `$.submitForm('/EntitySearch/Index', BusinessSearch)` directly in page
  context (skipping the reCAPTCHA AJAX) does not return results; the token-less
  POST is bounced back to the home page (`/`). The reCAPTCHA requirement is
  enforced on the server, not just in JavaScript. Don't waste time crafting a
  raw POST — confirmed dead end.
- **No JSON/REST API and no deep-link.** The entity search is a stateful ASP.NET
  MVC POST to `/EntitySearch/Index`; there is no query-string-driven results URL
  and no documented public API. (An internal `/UCCOnlineSearch/GetCrtificateDate`
  endpoint is unrelated to entity name search.) For bulk/programmatic needs, use
  the SCC's official **bulk data / data products** program rather than this UI —
  it is the sanctioned path and avoids the reCAPTCHA entirely.
- **Cookie consent is mandatory and stateful.** First load 302s to
  `/Cookie/CookieConsent?sessionExpired=False`. You must click **Accept** (sets
  the session cookie) before `/EntitySearch/Index` will render; otherwise you
  get redirected to `/Account/Login`.
- **Home-page quick search ≠ the real search.** The Entity Name box on the
  landing page (`#EntityName`) submits to a path that redirects to
  `/Account/Login`. Always use `/EntitySearch/Index` and
  `#BusinessSearch_Index_txtBusinessName`.
- **`#btnSearch` is an `input[type=button]`, not a submit.** Triggering the
  search requires its jQuery click handler (which runs the reCAPTCHA flow).
  Pressing Enter in the name field or submitting the `<form>` does not start the
  real search. The form's anti-forgery field `__RequestVerificationToken` is
  present and included in the submit payload.
- **Match-logic enum:** `#BEFilingSearch_ddlSearchLogic` → `2`=Starts With,
  `3`=Exact Match, `7`=Contains. The radio group `#BusinessSearch_Index_rdStartsWith`
  is the legacy equivalent; the dropdown is authoritative on the current page.
- **Sign-in is not required to search** (search is a public/anonymous function),
  so don't get sidetracked into the `/Account/Login` flow — it's a symptom of a
  missing session cookie or using the wrong (home-page) search box.

## Expected Output

The intended output shape once the reCAPTCHA wall is cleared. In the current
blocked state the skill returns the `blocked` shape.
