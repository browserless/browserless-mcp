# Explore Vecros GPS-Denied Navigation, Drones, Autonomy & Modules

## Purpose

Produce a structured overview of [Vecros](https://vecros.com)' GPS-denied (a.k.a. GPS-independent / "jamming-proof") navigation offering: the drones that use it (Athera, Jasper), the JETPIX autonomy stack that powers it, the Vecros Cloud (VCS) platform, and the hardware compute/flight-control modules sold on the separate `store.vecros.com` Shopify store. Read-only — this skill only navigates and extracts; it never submits forms, requests demos, or adds anything to a cart.

## When to Use

- Building a competitive/landscape brief on GPS-denied or "Level-4 autonomy" drone vendors.
- Extracting Athera / Jasper drone specs (flight time, range, onboard compute, payloads, position accuracy) and feature lists.
- Cataloging the JETPIX autonomy capabilities (vision-aided navigation, obstacle avoidance, tracking modes, onboard CV).
- Enumerating Vecros' purchasable hardware modules/boards (Jetcore flight controller, carrier boards, accessories) and prices.
- Any task that would otherwise scrape Vecros marketing pages — render the SPA, but get the module catalog from the Shopify JSON API.

## Workflow

`vecros.com` is a client-rendered **React SPA**: a plain `curl` / one-shot HTTP fetch returns only the empty `<div id="root">` shell with zero content. You **must** render it in a real browser. The hardware modules, however, live on a **separate Shopify store** (`store.vecros.com`) that exposes a clean, auth-free JSON API — use that instead of scraping product HTML. This is the recommended **hybrid** path; the all-browser fallback for modules is at the end.

No stealth is required: the pre-run probe reported no anti-bot, so a plain `browserless_agent` call (no `proxy` arg) renders every page and returns the Shopify JSON. The session persists across calls (keyed by `proxy`/`profile`), so the marketing pages can each run as their own `commands` array, or you can chain several `goto`/`text` pairs into a single call.

1. **Render the homepage.** One `browserless_agent` call, no `proxy`:

   ```json
   {
     "commands": [
       {
         "method": "goto",
         "params": {
           "url": "https://vecros.com/",
           "waitUntil": "load",
           "timeout": 45000
         }
       },
       { "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 2000 } },
       { "method": "text", "params": { "selector": "body" } }
     ]
   }
   ```

   The homepage nav confirms the product set: Athera, Jasper, Jetcore, Jetcore-FC. **Always include a `waitForTimeout` of ~2000ms (2–3s) after every `goto`** — the SPA hydrates asynchronously and the `text` read returns empty if you read too early.

2. **Athera — outdoor GPS-denied flagship drone.**

   ```json
   {
     "commands": [
       {
         "method": "goto",
         "params": {
           "url": "https://vecros.com/products/athera",
           "waitUntil": "load",
           "timeout": 45000
         }
       },
       { "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 2000 } },
       { "method": "text", "params": { "selector": "body" } }
     ]
   }
   ```

   Extract the description ("India's 1st Spatial AI Drone … mission-grade autonomy deployment system"), feature bullets, and the spec block: max flight time **35 min**, position accuracy **5 cm** (no GPS), transmission/BVLOS range **10 km**, onboard compute **NVIDIA Xavier NX (40 TOPS)**, **4G BVLOS** comms, **360° obstacle avoidance**, configurable payloads (10× optical-zoom, RGB+thermal, RGB AI cameras).

3. **JETPIX — the autonomy stack.**

   ```json
   {
     "commands": [
       {
         "method": "goto",
         "params": {
           "url": "https://vecros.com/JETPIX-autonomy",
           "waitUntil": "load",
           "timeout": 45000
         }
       },
       { "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 2000 } },
       { "method": "text", "params": { "selector": "body" } }
     ]
   }
   ```

   Note the **non-standard path**: it is `/JETPIX-autonomy` (capitalized, no `/products/` prefix). Extract the "Perception Made Simple" positioning and capabilities: vision-aided (GPS-independent) navigation, 4-direction obstacle avoidance, Active Track, Point of Interest, Return to Home, and onboard computer vision (Object Detection, Semantic Segmentation, Object Recognition, Landmark Detection).

4. **Jasper — indoor GPS-denied drone (optional).** Linked from the homepage nav. `goto` `/products/jasper` the same way (goto + waitForTimeout + text) for the warehouse/enclosed-space platform if indoor coverage is needed. (Not listed in sitemap.xml — see gotchas.)

5. **Vecros Cloud (VCS).**

   ```json
   {
     "commands": [
       {
         "method": "goto",
         "params": {
           "url": "https://vecros.com/products/vecros-cloud",
           "waitUntil": "load",
           "timeout": 45000
         }
       },
       { "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 2000 } },
       { "method": "text", "params": { "selector": "body" } }
     ]
   }
   ```

   Capture the platform summary (VCS Drive, VCS Fleet, VCS Inspect / 3D digital twin, VCS wPilot web piloting).

6. **Hardware modules — Shopify JSON API (no scraping).** `store.vecros.com/products.json` is same-origin JSON, so just `goto` the URL and read the body — no page hydration wait needed for a raw JSON document:

   ```json
   {
     "commands": [
       {
         "method": "goto",
         "params": {
           "url": "https://store.vecros.com/products.json?limit=50",
           "waitUntil": "load",
           "timeout": 45000
         }
       },
       { "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 1000 } },
       { "method": "text", "params": { "selector": "body" } }
     ]
   }
   ```

   Returns the full product catalog as JSON — `products[].handle`, `.title`, `.variants[].price`, `.variants[].title`. ~14 products today. The flagship compute/flight-control modules are `jetcore-flight-controller-board` (JETCORE-FC, flight control + edge AI on one board, Xavier NX / Orin NX options) and `jetcore-carrier-board` (JETCORE, "Made in India" Jetson carrier board); the rest are expansion boards, cables, cooling, and storage accessories. `products.json` is the **canonical machine-readable source** — `limit` accepts up to 250; paginate with `&page=N` if the catalog grows.

7. **Synthesize** the structured JSON in Expected Output. Stop here — read-only.

### Browser fallback (modules)

If `store.vecros.com/products.json` is ever blocked or rate-limited (not observed — it was open and fast in testing), `goto` `https://store.vecros.com/collections/all`, `waitForTimeout`, and read the product cards (title + price) from a `text` (selector `body`), then `goto` individual `/products/<handle>` pages for full descriptions/variants.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **`vecros.com` is a React SPA — `curl` / a raw HTTP fetch return an empty shell.** The response is `<!doctype html>…<div id="root"></div>` + a `main.<hash>.js` bundle and nothing else. You must render in a real browser (`browserless_agent` `goto`). This is the single most important thing to know about this site.
- **Always wait after `goto`.** Include a `waitForTimeout` of ~2000ms (2–3s) before the `text` read; the SPA hydrates async and reads too-early come back empty.
- **No anti-bot.** Pre-run probe: none detected (HTTP 200, Fastly-cached). A plain `browserless_agent` call — **no `proxy` arg** — renders every page and returns the Shopify JSON cleanly. Don't waste budget on stealth here.
- **The `text` read includes inline CSS noise.** The SPA injects `@keyframes …` style blocks into the rendered text; ignore the CSS and read the marketing copy that follows it.
- **JETPIX lives at a non-standard URL: `/JETPIX-autonomy`** — capitalized, and NOT under `/products/`. Guessing `/products/jetpix` will 404 to the SPA's catch-all.
- **Hardware modules are on a SEPARATE domain.** `store.vecros.com` is a Shopify storefront, distinct from the `vecros.com` marketing SPA. Don't look for a `/store` or `/shop` route on `vecros.com` — go straight to `store.vecros.com/products.json`.
- **sitemap.xml is incomplete.** `https://vecros.com/sitemap.xml` lists `/`, `/products/athera`, `/products/vecros-cloud`, `/JETPIX-autonomy`, the `/solution/*`, `/resources/*`, `/support/*` and `/about-us/team` pages — but **not** Jasper or the Jetcore product pages, which are only reachable via the homepage nav. Don't treat the sitemap as the full page inventory.
- **A cookie-consent banner ("We value your privacy" / I accept · I decline) overlays the bottom of every page.** It does NOT block `get text body` extraction and can be ignored for read-only work; it may obscure the bottom of full-page screenshots.
- **Shopify `products.json` is the canonical module catalog** — auth-free, fast, structured. `limit` up to 250, `?page=N` for pagination. Prefer it over rendering store HTML.
