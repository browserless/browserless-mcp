# Scrape Blockchain Intelligence Team Data

## Purpose

Collect the complete team/staff roster of the Blockchain Intelligence Professionals Association (BIPA, `blockchaintelligence.com`) and return one structured record per member: full name, role/job title, profile URL, photo URL, and full biography. This is a **read-only** extraction. The site is a WordPress install, so the fast path is its REST API for the roster plus a single plain-HTTP GET per member for the bio — no scripted browsing required.

## When to Use

- "Scrape / collect the team (or staff, leadership, members) of blockchaintelligence.com."
- Building a contact/people dataset for BIPA (names, titles, bios, headshots).
- Monitoring the team page for added/removed members or role changes.
- Any task needing the canonical list of certified specialists / chairman listed under `/meet-our-team/`.

## Workflow

The optimal method is **HTTP, not a full browser drive**. Every relevant page is static, server-rendered HTML behind Cloudflare that serves `200` to plain GETs (no JS challenge, no proxy needed for these paths). Use any HTTP client — or, under restricted egress, `browserless_function` (`page.goto('https://blockchaintelligence.com/')` then a same-origin `fetch`) for the WP REST JSON, and `browserless_agent` `goto` + `text`/`evaluate` for the static `/team/{slug}/` HTML. Do not script a full browser drive unless the HTTP path starts returning challenges.

1. **Get the roster in one call (WP REST API).** The "Meet our team" page is WordPress page id `9769`. Fetch its rendered content:

   ```
   GET https://blockchaintelligence.com/wp-json/wp/v2/pages?slug=meet-our-team
   ```

   Parse the JSON, take `result[0].content.rendered`. It contains one `<div class="team-block …">` per member. From each block extract:
   - **profile_url** — `href="https://blockchaintelligence.com/team/{slug}/"`
   - **photo_url** — the `<img src="…wp-content/uploads/….jpg">`
   - **name** — text of `<div class="team-name"><a …>NAME</a></div>`
   - **role** — text of `<div class="team-job">ROLE</div>`

   As of the last run this yields **7 members**: Bogdan VACUSTA (Chairman), Aurel HUSTEA, Vasile LUPU, Diana PATRUT, Alina Gabriela POPESCU, Catalin VREME, Claudiu ZBIRCEA.

2. **Enrich each member with their bio (per-member GET).** Bios are NOT in the REST API (see Gotchas). For each `profile_url` from step 1:

   ```
   GET https://blockchaintelligence.com/team/{slug}/
   ```

   From the returned HTML extract:
   - **name** — `<div class="team-name …">NAME</div>` (confirms the roster value)
   - **role** — `<div class="team-job">ROLE</div>`
   - **bio** — concatenate the `<p>…</p>` paragraphs inside `<div class="team-content …">`. If that selector misses, fall back to the `<meta property="og:description">` value (a truncated one-paragraph summary).
   - **photo** — `<meta property="og:image">` (same image as the roster).

3. **Decode HTML entities** in every text field: `&amp;`→`&`, `&#8217;`→`'`, `&#8211;`→`–`, `&#039;`→`'`, `&nbsp;`→space, then strip residual tags and collapse whitespace.

4. **Emit JSON** — one object per member plus a top-level count and the roster endpoint used (see Expected Output).

### Browser fallback

Only if the HTTP path is ever Cloudflare-challenged, run one `browserless_agent` call (add `proxy: { proxy: "residential" }` if challenged), keeping all steps in its `commands` array:

1. `{ "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "https://blockchaintelligence.com/meet-our-team/", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } }`.
2. Dismiss the "We value your privacy" cookie banner (a `click` on **Accept All**) if it overlaps content.
3. `{ "method": "text", "params": { "selector": "body" } }` (or fold the parse into an `evaluate`) to pull the roster, then `goto` each `/team/{slug}/` for bios. Same `.team-name` / `.team-job` / `.team-content` structure renders in the DOM.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **WordPress site (LiteSpeed + Cloudflare).** Response headers advertise `Link: <…/wp-json/>; rel="https://api.w.org/"` and `X-Tec-Api-Root` — confirming the REST API is live and open (no auth required for reads).
- **The `team` post type is NOT REST-registered.** `GET /wp-json/wp/v2/team` returns `404 rest_no_route`, and `team` does not appear in `/wp-json/wp/v2/types`. Don't waste time hunting for a `/wp/v2/team` collection — it doesn't exist. The roster only lives inside the Elementor-built `meet-our-team` _page_ content, and bios only on the `/team/{slug}/` HTML pages.
- **Roster is rendered by the GavickPro "gva-teams" Elementor widget.** Member blocks use stable classes: `.team-block`, `.team-image`, `.team-name`, `.team-job`. Each member link appears **twice** per block (image link + name link) — de-duplicate by slug.
- **Proxies / verified NOT required for the data path.** The homepage shows a Cloudflare + hCaptcha posture (pre-run probe flagged `likelyNeedsProxies: true` for `/`), but the WP REST API endpoint and every `/team/{slug}/` and `/meet-our-team/` page returned `200` over a plain HTTP GET with **no** residential proxy and **no** stealth. Only add a residential proxy if you later get a Cloudflare interstitial.
- **Sitemaps don't help enumerate the team.** `/sitemap.xml` (Google Sitemap Generator) splits into `post-sitemap.xml` / `page-sitemap.xml` / `sitemap-misc.xml` — there is no dedicated team sitemap, and `/wp-sitemap.xml` returns an empty urlset. `/sitemap_index.xml` 404s. Use the roster page, not the sitemap, as the source of truth for the member list.
- **Cookie consent banner** ("We value your privacy") overlays the lower-right of pages in a real browser. It does not affect HTTP fetches; only matters for the browser fallback / screenshots.
- **Detail pages are heavy (~130 KB HTML)** because of the full Elementor theme; the `.team-content` bio block is a small slice. Parse, don't render.
- **Member count is small and can change** (7 at last capture). Always re-derive the count from the roster rather than hardcoding.
