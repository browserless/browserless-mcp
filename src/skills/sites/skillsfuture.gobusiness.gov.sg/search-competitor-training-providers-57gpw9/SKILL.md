# Search Competitor Training Providers in the SkillsFuture Course Directory

## Purpose

Search the SkillsFuture for Business Course Directory (`skillsfuture.gobusiness.gov.sg/course-directory/search`) for training providers and the SSG-supported courses they run, returning a structured, per-provider research list: course themes/titles, funding schemes (SFEC / Industry-Supported / Absentee Payroll), indicative pre- and post-subsidy pricing, ratings, course format/duration, and the course-detail URL. Read-only — never registers, logs in, or submits anything. Every course in this directory is SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG)-supported and eligible for SFEC + Absentee Payroll funding, which makes it the authoritative source for mapping grant-funded training competitors targeting Singapore SMEs.

## When to Use

- Building a competitor / market-mapping list of training providers in a capability area (e.g. digital marketing, digital transformation, data analytics, sustainability/ESG) for Singapore SMEs.
- Pulling every SSG-funded course a named provider runs, with funding tags and subsidised pricing.
- Filtering the directory to grant-relevant cohorts (e.g. `keywords=Digital Economy`, or the `SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit (SFEC)` facet) and aggregating by provider.
- Anywhere you'd otherwise hand-scrape the directory — the search results are server-rendered into the page HTML, so a plain HTTP fetch returns the full structured dataset without driving a browser.

## Workflow

The page is a Next.js (App Router) app, **but the search results are server-side-rendered** into the initial HTML as a React Server Component (RSC) "Flight" payload (`self.__next_f.push([...])` script chunks). That payload carries every field the cards display — provider, title, rating, funding tags, fees at each subsidy tier, course runs, and the course-detail link. **Lead with a plain HTTP GET of a deep-link URL and parse that payload.** No login, cookies, JS execution, residential proxy, or stealth required (confirmed: a bare server-side HTTP GET of the deep-link returns HTTP 200 with all 10/25/50/100 cards plus the total result count). The browser path (below) is a fallback, mainly useful for discovering exact filter-facet values.

1. **Build the deep-link URL.** Search and paging are entirely URL-driven — you do **not** need to type into the search box:

   ```
   https://skillsfuture.gobusiness.gov.sg/course-directory/search
       ?search_query=digital+marketing      # spaces as '+' (or %20)
       &page_size=100                        # 10 | 25 | 50 | 100  (100 = fewest round-trips)
       &page=0                               # ZERO-indexed
       &sort_by=relevance                    # see Gotchas for other values
       &keywords=Digital+Economy             # optional facet; exact display string, '+'-encoded
   ```

2. **Fetch it.** Drive a `browserless_function` that navigates to the deep-link and parses the payload **in-page**. The SSR HTML is ~580 KB — over the ~200 KB text-return cap — so extract the cards inside `page.evaluate` and return a compact projection; never ship the raw HTML back. No login, cookies, or stealth needed; add a top-level `proxy: { proxy: "residential" }` only if you ever see a regional block (not needed today).

   ```js
   export default async ({ page }) => {
     const url =
       'https://skillsfuture.gobusiness.gov.sg/course-directory/search' +
       '?search_query=digital+marketing&keywords=Digital+Economy' +
       '&sort_by=relevance&page_size=100&page=0';
     await page.goto(url, { waitUntil: 'load', timeout: 45000 });
     const out = await page.evaluate(() => {
       // Search results are server-rendered as RSC "Flight" chunks in self.__next_f.push([...])
       const payload = (self.__next_f || [])
         .map((c) => (Array.isArray(c) ? c[1] : ''))
         .join('');
       const totalM = payload.match(/\"children\":\[\"(\d+)\",\" \"/); // total result count (step 3)
       // Walk each card with the anchors in steps 4-5 and push a compact object per course:
       //   { provider, title, course_id, url, is_industry_supported, rating,
       //     rating_count, tags, full_course_fee, after_subsidy_from, after_sfec_from }
       const courses = [/* parsed per steps 4-5 */];
       return JSON.stringify({ total: totalM ? +totalM[1] : null, courses });
     });
     return { data: out, type: 'application/json' };
   };
   ```

   Page by re-calling with `page=0,1,2,…` for `ceil(total / page_size)` calls. There is no session-release step, and one call handles a full page start-to-finish; each call is self-contained and re-navigates to its own deep-link, so it does not depend on session state carried from a prior call.

3. **Read the total result count.** It is rendered as the `"children":["87"," ",{...,"children":"results"}]` node near the top of the payload — match `\"children\":\["(\d+)\"," "` to get the integer (`87` for `digital marketing` + `Digital Economy`). Use it to decide how many pages to fetch: `ceil(total / page_size)`, incrementing `page` from `0`.

4. **Extract each course object.** Each card is an RSC component (`$L63`) whose fields appear in order in the payload. The values are JSON-escaped (`\"`). Per course you get:
   - `subtitle` → **training provider name** (e.g. `@ASK TRAINING PTE. LTD.`)
   - `title` → course title
   - `isIndustrySupported` → boolean (sector-body endorsement)
   - `rating` (number or `$undefined`) + `ratingDetail` (review count, e.g. `"2,256"`)
   - `tags` → array, e.g. `["Digital Economy","SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit (SFEC)"]` (funding/economy facets)
   - `courseDuration`, `modeOfTraining`, `language`, `courseHours`, `courseRuns[]` (each with start/end dates, intake size, learning style, registration window)
   - `label`/`labelDataValue` → `"Full course fee"` / `"S$300.00"` (full pre-subsidy fee, **exclusive of GST**)
   - `secondLabel`/`secondLabelDataValue` → `"After subsidy"` / `"From S$90.00"` (after baseline SSG subsidy)
   - `supportingDataLabel`/`supportingDataValue` → `"After SFEC"` / `"From S$9.00"` (after SFEC tops up 90% of nett)
   - `linkUrl` → `/course-directory/courses/{TGS-id}` (canonical course-detail URL)

   A robust regex anchor is `\"isIndustrySupported\":(true|false),\"subtitle\":\"...\",\"title\":\"...\"`, then scan the next ~3.5 KB of the payload for the fee/`linkUrl`/`tags` fields belonging to that card.

5. **Aggregate by provider.** Group courses by `subtitle`. Per provider record: course count, sample course titles (themes), the union of funding `tags`, the full-fee and after-subsidy price range, and whether any course is `isIndustrySupported`. This is the competitor row a commercial/product team consumes.

6. **(Optional) enrich from the course-detail page.** Load `https://skillsfuture.gobusiness.gov.sg/course-directory/courses/{TGS-id}` (also SSR) the same way — a `browserless_function` navigate + in-page parse, or a `browserless_agent` with a `text` command on `body`. Adds: provider website URL, the recognising industry body (e.g. "recognized and supported by Singapore Computer Society (SCS)"), EIS supporting period, contact person (name / phone / email), full course overview, learning outcomes, and entry requirements.

7. **(Optional) enumerate the full provider universe.** The left-panel **Training Provider** facet lists every provider in the directory alphabetically (~440 entities, also in the SSR payload). Read it to build a complete provider roster, then drill in per provider with `search_query` empty + the provider checkbox.

### Browser fallback

Use only when you need to discover exact filter-facet values, or if the RSC payload format changes. Drive a bare (non-stealth, no-proxy) `browserless_agent` session, keeping the whole flow in one `commands` array so the session persists across steps:

1. Load and let the client-side results hydrate:
   ```json
   { "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "<deep-link url>", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } }
   { "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 4000 } }
   ```
2. Read the body with `{ "method": "text", "params": { "selector": "body" } }` — each result renders as a markdown link containing provider, title, rating, funding tag, duration, full fee, and "After subsidy" price; the `/course-directory/courses/TGS-…` href is the course id.
3. To learn a filter's exact URL value, chain in the same call: a `snapshot` (a11y tree) to get the checkbox ref, a `click` on the facet's checkbox (selector/ref from the snapshot), `{ "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 1500 } }`, then `{ "method": "evaluate", "params": { "content": "JSON.stringify(window.location.href)" } }` — the applied value is appended to the query string (e.g. clicking _Digital Economy_ appends `&keywords=Digital+Economy`).

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **No public JSON API.** The upstream SSG data API is called server-side only; the client never sees clean JSON. The closest thing to an API is the **RSC Flight payload embedded in the SSR HTML** — parse that. Don't hunt for an `/api/...` XHR; there isn't one (the only client fetches are Next.js RSC navigations with an opaque `RSC: 1` body, GA/analytics, and the VICA chatbot).
- **`page` is zero-indexed.** `page=0` is the first page. Off-by-one here silently skips the first cohort of results.
- **`search_query` uses `+` (or `%20`) for spaces; the param name matters.** `search_query=digital+marketing` works (550 results); guessing `q=` / `searchValue=` is **ignored** and returns the full unfiltered directory (20,936 results) — a silent failure that looks like success. Always sanity-check the total count against the keyword.
- **The `/course-directory/search/{keyword}` PATH 404s.** Search is a query-string, not a path segment. `…/search/digital%20marketing` returns "Page not found".
- **`keywords` facet takes the exact display string.** Valid values (each `+`-encoded): `Care Economy`, `Digital Economy`, `Green Economy`, `SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit (SFEC)`, `Critical Core Skills`. These are the SSG "economy/credit" facets — `Digital Economy` is the right cut for MarTech / digital-transformation competitor mapping.
- **`areas_of_training` is a real param but is NOT free-text.** The param name is confirmed (`areas_of_training=` returns `0 results` when the value doesn't match the site's internal taxonomy, vs. unknown params which are ignored and return everything). The Area-of-Training options render via a virtualised list that does **not** reliably appear in the a11y snapshot, so don't guess the value — apply the checkbox in the browser fallback and copy the exact value the URL receives. Area labels include "Advertising, Sales & Marketing", "Information and Communications", "Marine & Port Services", "Transportation and Storage", "Wholesale and Retail Trade" (relevant ICP sectors).
- **`sort_by=relevance` is confirmed.** Other UI sort options (Price low→high / high→low, Most Viewed, Ratings high→low / low→high, Alphabetical A–Z / Z–A) map to other `sort_by` values — capture the exact token via the browser fallback (read the URL after picking the dropdown) rather than guessing.
- **Fees are exclusive of GST and the "After subsidy" / "After SFEC" figures are "From" floors** (best-case, depends on employee profile — SME vs non-SME, SC/PR/LTVP+, age). Treat post-subsidy prices as indicative minimums, not quotes. SMEs get up to 90% baseline subsidy; SFEC defrays a further 90% of the nett.
- **`isIndustrySupported` ≠ a funding scheme.** It means a sector body (e.g. Singapore Computer Society) endorses the course; funding eligibility is conveyed by the `tags` (SFEC) and the universal SSG-support of every directory course. A card can be `isIndustrySupported:false` yet still SFEC-funded.
- **`rating` can be `$undefined`** in the payload (rendered as "No rating") — handle the non-numeric sentinel when parsing.
- **Result count is capped per search, not per provider.** A keyword search returns courses; one provider can own many cards. Aggregate client-side. To get the _complete_ provider list independent of any keyword, read the Training Provider facet (≈440 entities) rather than paginating a search.
- **No anti-bot wall observed.** Pre-run probe reported no anti-bots; both the bare HTTP fetch and a non-stealth browser session returned full content. CloudFront fronts the site but did not challenge. stealth/a residential proxy are unnecessary.
- **Scheduled maintenance banner.** The site shows a maintenance notice; certain SkillsFuture-for-Business services can be briefly unavailable per the published schedule — retry rather than treating a transient failure as a block.

Per-course shape (before aggregation), exactly as extracted from the RSC payload:

```json
{
  "provider": "SKILLS DEVELOPMENT ACADEMY PTE. LTD.",
  "title": "Introduction to Digital Marketing",
  "course_id": "TGS-2021010044",
  "url": "https://skillsfuture.gobusiness.gov.sg/course-directory/courses/TGS-2021010044",
  "is_industry_supported": false,
  "rating": 5.0,
  "rating_count": "3,686",
  "tags": ["Digital Economy", "SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit (SFEC)"],
  "duration": "2 - 3 Days",
  "course_hours": 16,
  "mode_of_training": ["Part Time"],
  "language": ["English"],
  "full_course_fee": "S$800.00",
  "after_subsidy_from": "From S$240.00",
  "after_sfec_from": "From S$24.00"
}
```

Notes:

- `funding_schemes` is inferred: every directory course is SSG-supported (baseline subsidy + Absentee Payroll + SFEC-eligible); the SFEC `tag` confirms SFEC, and any explicit economy/credit facet is surfaced under `facets`.
- `rating` may be absent (`$undefined` → "No rating"); `after_*` figures are best-case "From" floors, GST-exclusive.

```
