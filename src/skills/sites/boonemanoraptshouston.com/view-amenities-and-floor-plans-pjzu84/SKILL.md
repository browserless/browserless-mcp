# Boone Manor Amenities & Floor Plans

## Purpose

Read-only skill that returns a complete picture of Boone Manor (a luxury high-rise in Houston's Museum District): the in-unit and community amenities, the surrounding neighborhood perks, and the full floor-plan catalog with bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, base rent, total ("all-in") monthly price, availability, and quoted lease term. All data lives in static, server-rendered HTML — no login, no JavaScript execution, and no API authentication are required.

## When to Use

- A user asks "what amenities does Boone Manor have?" (in-unit vs. community).
- A user wants to know what's nearby / the neighborhood (dining, arts, shopping, location).
- A user wants the list of floor plans, or wants pricing/availability for a specific unit type (studio, 1/2/3-bedroom, or a named penthouse plan).
- A user wants to compare square footage, bed/bath counts, or rent across plans.
- A user needs the fee breakdown that turns "base rent" into the advertised monthly price.

## Workflow

The recommended method is **`fetch`** (plain HTTP GET). Every page on this site is rendered server-side by the Spherexx platform; the floor-plan pricing, availability, amenities, and neighborhood content are all present in the initial HTML response. A headless browser is unnecessary — a single GET per page returns everything. (A browser fallback is documented at the end for screenshot capture.)

1. **Always use the `www.` host.** The apex domain `https://boonemanoraptshouston.com/` returns a `301` redirect to `https://www.boonemanoraptshouston.com/`. Request the `www.` URLs directly to avoid the hop.

2. **Get the amenities** — fetch `https://www.boonemanoraptshouston.com/amenities/`. The complete categorized list is inside the `div.amenity__full-list-content` block, grouped under `<h3>` category headings (`Apartments` = in-unit, `Community` = building/shared). The 15 items shown in the hero (`li.amenity__item`) are the same set, just un-grouped.

3. **Get the neighborhood** — fetch `https://www.boonemanoraptshouston.com/neighborhood/`. Content lives in the `section.neighborhood-perks` slider: four category headlines (`Central Location`, `Dining & Restaurants Nearby`, `Local Arts & Culture`, `Shopping Nearby`) each with a `div.desktop-description` paragraph that names specific nearby places.

4. **Get the FULL floor-plan catalog** — do NOT rely on `/floorplans/` alone (it only renders _currently available_ "Featured Plans" — 3-4 articles). To enumerate all 34 plans including the unavailable ones, fetch each per-type page:
   - `https://www.boonemanoraptshouston.com/floorplans/studio/`
   - `https://www.boonemanoraptshouston.com/floorplans/1bedroom/`
   - `https://www.boonemanoraptshouston.com/floorplans/2bedroom/`
   - `https://www.boonemanoraptshouston.com/floorplans/3bedroom/`
   - `https://www.boonemanoraptshouston.com/floorplans/penthouse/`

5. **Parse each `<article class="floorplans__floorplan">`.** Numeric pricing is in `data-*` attributes on the `<article>`; the human-readable bed/bath/sqft/availability/term are in the article's text:
   - `data-fp` — internal floor-plan ID (stable, e.g. `12596`)
   - `data-base-price` / `data-base-unit-price` — base rent (e.g. `2376`)
   - `data-fee-total-property` — mandatory monthly fee bundle added to base (`149`)
   - `data-fee-total-floorplan` — plan-specific fee add (usually `0`)
   - `data-all-in` — advertised "Total Monthly Leasing Price" = base + fees (e.g. `2525`)
   - Article text yields: plan name, `STUDIO`/`N BED`, `N Bath`, `### SF` (or a range like `849-868 SF`), the quoted lease term (e.g. `14 months`), and the availability token (`N Available`, a date like `7-14-2026`, or `Call For Pricing` + `Not Currently Available`).

6. **(Optional) Fee detail** — `https://www.boonemanoraptshouston.com/floorplans/` contains a "Fee Overview" section enumerating one-time and monthly fees. The four mandatory monthly "Essentials" (Amenity $85, Pest Control $6, Trash $30, Package Locker $28) sum to the `$149` `data-fee-total-property` value baked into every all-in price.

7. **Assemble** the JSON per the Expected Output schema.

### Browser fallback

If you need screenshots or the interactive floor-plan diagrams/photos, drive one `browserless_agent` call (no stealth needed — see gotchas) with these `commands`:

```json
{ "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "https://www.boonemanoraptshouston.com/floorplans/2bedroom/", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } },
{ "method": "text", "params": { "selector": "body" } },
{ "method": "screenshot" }
```

The rendered DOM matches the fetched HTML. No session-release step — there's nothing to release. (The browser session actually persists across separate `browserless_agent` calls, keyed by the call's `proxy`/`profile` config; this fetch-first skill just doesn't rely on that.)

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **`/floorplans/` only lists available units.** Its "Featured Plans" section renders just the 3-4 plans with live availability. The complete 34-plan catalog (including 25+ plans marked "Not Currently Available / Call For Pricing") is only reachable via the per-bedroom pages (`/floorplans/studio/`, `/1bedroom/`, `/2bedroom/`, `/3bedroom/`, `/penthouse/`). Skipping these will silently undercount the catalog.
- **Apex → www 301.** `boonemanoraptshouston.com` redirects to `www.boonemanoraptshouston.com`. Use `www.` directly.
- **No anti-bot, no stealth required.** Pre-run probe reported no anti-bots; a plain HTTP GET (no proxy) and a plain `browserless_agent` session (no proxy, no stealth) both returned full content with `200`. Don't waste budget enabling a proxy here.
- **Pricing is in HTML, not an API.** There is no separate availability/pricing JSON endpoint worth calling — the Spherexx backend embeds everything as `data-*` attributes on `<article class="floorplans__floorplan">`. Parse the HTML; don't hunt for `/api/...`.
- **"All-in" ≠ base rent.** The big advertised number ("X.00 /mo*", `data-all-in`) is the _Total Monthly Leasing Price_ = base rent + `$149` mandatory monthly fees. The asterisk on the page footnotes this. Surface both `base_price` and `all_in_price` so users aren't surprised.
- **Availability token has three shapes:** a count ("`2 Available`"), a future move-in date ("`7-14-2026`", meaning available from that date), or "`Not Currently Available`" paired with "`Call For Pricing`" (no price shown — `data-all-in`/`data-base-price` absent or zero). Normalize accordingly.
- **Square footage can be a range** (e.g. `689-733 SF`, `849-868 SF`) when multiple unit variants share a plan name. Preserve the range string rather than forcing a single integer.
- **Penthouse plans use coded names** (`E2PH`, `A3PH`, `B10PH`, …) instead of "The {Name}" names; they live under `/floorplans/penthouse/` and `/penthouse-collection/`. As of the last capture, only 2 of the 15 penthouse plans were available.
- **Promotional banner is dynamic marketing copy** ("Spring Into Savings – Up to 8 Weeks Free", "Medical Center & Student 'Match' Specials"). It is not a per-plan discount and is not reflected in `data-all-in`; treat it as a site-wide concession note, not authoritative pricing.
- **Values change frequently.** Prices, availability counts, and move-in dates update as units lease. The IDs (`data-fp`), names, bed/bath, and sqft are stable; price/availability are point-in-time. Re-fetch for current numbers.

Notes on the schema:

- `square_feet` is a string to preserve ranges (e.g. `"849-868"`).
- `bedrooms: 0` denotes a studio.
- `availability.status` is one of `available` (has `units_available` count or a future `available_date`) or `not_available` (shown as "Call For Pricing / Not Currently Available", with prices null).
- `all_in_price = base_price + fee_total_property (149) + fee_total_floorplan (0)`. Report both base and all-in.
- The example lists three representative plans; a full run returns all 34 articles parsed from the five per-type pages.
