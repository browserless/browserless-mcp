# Compose Email with Emojis for Your Ideas

## Purpose

Look up emojis on **emojis.directory** that match the key ideas/concepts in an email body, then assemble an email-ready text payload (subject + body) with those emojis interleaved through the copy. The site itself is a static emoji lookup directory — it does **not** send mail, and it does **not** expose any `mailto:` composer; the deliverable of this skill is **structured text** (`{subject, body, emojis_used[]}`) that the caller is expected to paste into their own mail client (Gmail compose, Outlook, Apple Mail, etc.). Read-only: never submits, posts, or interacts with anything beyond GETting public HTML.

## When to Use

- A user has draft email copy (or a topic + tone) and wants suggested emojis sprinkled through the body to emphasize ideas.
- You need to look up the canonical Unicode emoji character (not an image) for a specific concept ("brainstorm", "celebrate", "next steps") to drop into outgoing text.
- You need a batch of conceptually-related emojis (e.g. all the "mailbox / envelope" variants) and want a stable, JS-free source that doesn't require an API key.
- You want to avoid hallucinating wrong code points — emojis.directory page URLs map 1:1 to Unicode CLDR short-names, so fetched results are verifiable.

## Workflow

emojis.directory is a static Astro site fronted by Cloudflare. **There is no API, but the search results page and every emoji detail page are fully server-rendered HTML** — no JS execution required to extract emoji characters. The optimal path is direct HTTPS GETs against three URL shapes; a browser session is only needed when the caller wants visual confirmation or to use the dynamic **Emoji Keyboard** tool.

> **Transport note (Browserless):** the GETs below are plain HTTPS — run them from any HTTP client and regex the returned HTML. If you prefer to parse in-page (or are under restricted egress), a single `browserless_agent` `goto` the search/detail URL + `evaluate` returning the `.icon-item` / `data-clipboard-text` values does the same job without shipping raw HTML back.

1. **Decompose the email idea-by-idea.** Take the draft body (or topic if no draft) and produce an ordered list of 3–8 _concept tokens_ — single words or short phrases that name an idea per sentence/paragraph. Examples for a launch email: `["new product", "team effort", "rocket / launch", "feedback request", "thanks"]`. These tokens become your search queries in step 2.

2. **Resolve each concept → emoji via the search endpoint.**

   ```
   GET https://emojis.directory/?s={query}
   ```

   The query matches as a **substring against the emoji's Unicode CLDR short-name** (the same string used in the URL slug). It is **not** semantic — see the "semantic queries fail" gotcha below. Parse the response HTML:
   - Emoji characters appear as: `<span class="icon-item">{emoji}</span>` in the results grid.
   - The link/label next to each is: `<a href="/{slug}-emoji-copy-paste/">{human-readable name}</a>`.
   - Regex: `/icon-item">([^<]+)<\/span>[\s\S]*?<a href="(\/[a-z0-9-]+-emoji-copy-paste\/)">([^<]+)<\/a>/g`.
   - "No matches" response: the page renders `<p>No emojis found matching <strong>{query}</strong>. Try a different search.</p>` — detect that string before iterating results.

   If a query returns zero results, retry with a different word-stem from the same concept (e.g. `idea` → `bulb`, `brain`, `think`; `target` → `direct hit`; `email` → `mail` or `envelope`). See the lexicon in the gotchas section.

3. **(Optional) Pull the canonical character from the detail page.** When you need _exactly one_ emoji for a concept and the search returns several, GET the specific detail page:

   ```
   GET https://emojis.directory/{slug}-emoji-copy-paste/
   ```

   The page exposes the canonical character in two redundant places:
   - `<span class="icon-item">{emoji}</span>` inside `<div class="single-icon">`.
   - `<button class="btn cpybtn copy-btn ..." data-clipboard-text="{emoji}">Copy</button>` — this `data-clipboard-text` attribute is the byte-for-byte string the site itself ships to the clipboard, including any variation-selector / ZWJ sequences. Prefer it over scraping the `<span>` when codepoint exactness matters.
   - Page `<title>` is `"{Name} Emoji Copy Paste ― {emoji}"` (em-dash separator `―`, U+2015).

4. **(Optional) Browse a category for thematic packs.** For sets-of-related emojis (holiday card, food-themed newsletter, country flags), GET a category page instead of running multiple searches:

   ```
   GET https://emojis.directory/{category}-emojis/
   ```

   Known categories: `person`, `country-flags`, `animals-and-nature`, `food-and-drinks`, `travel-and-places`, `hands-and-other-body-parts`, `christmas`, `thanksgiving`, `halloween`, `cursed`, `cute`. Plus `/kaomoji/`, `/kawaii/`, `/emoticons/`, `/lenny-faces/`, `/text-faces/`, `/shrug-faces/` (no trailing `-emojis` segment for those six). The same `<span class="icon-item">…</span>` selector applies.

5. **Assemble the email.** Build the output object with `subject`, `body`, and a `emojis_used[]` audit trail. Sensible interleaving conventions:
   - **Subject**: one leading emoji + space + headline. Example: `🚀 Launching next Tuesday`.
   - **Body**: place one emoji _before_ the sentence that introduces each idea (not at the end — leading emojis are more accessible for screen readers and don't collide with terminal punctuation). Keep density to ≤ 1 emoji per ~25–40 words; more reads as spammy.
   - For multi-codepoint emojis (skin-tone modifiers, flags, ZWJ family sequences), always use the exact `data-clipboard-text` value from step 3 — splitting the bytes will render as separate broken glyphs in most mail clients.

6. **Return** the assembled payload to the caller. Do **not** attempt to open Gmail / Outlook / Apple Mail to actually send — this skill is text-generation only.

### Browser fallback

A residential proxy / stealth session is not required for any of the above (Cloudflare serves cached HTML at the edge). Use a browser only when:

- The caller wants screenshots of the rendered detail page (e.g. to confirm Apple-style vs. Google-style emoji rendering — both are just font fallbacks; the underlying codepoint is identical).
- You need to use the **Emoji Keyboard** at `/emoji-keyboard/`, where the random-emoji grid is populated client-side via JS on tag click. Drive it with one `browserless_agent` call: `goto` the page, `click` the `.keyboard-tag-select[data-tag="…"]` chips, then `evaluate` `[...document.querySelectorAll('.icon-item')].map(n=>n.textContent)` to read the rendered emoji nodes. Detail pages and search results do **not** need this — they are fully server-rendered.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **Search is substring-on-slug, not semantic.** `?s=idea` returns **zero results** — no Unicode emoji has "idea" in its CLDR short-name. To find idea-related emojis you must query stem keywords: `bulb` → 💡, `brain` → 🧠, `think` → 🤔. Other dead-end semantic queries observed: `email` (use `mail` or `envelope` instead — `?s=mail` returns 📪📫📧📭📬, `?s=envelope` returns ✉️📩📨🧧), `target` (use `direct hit`, the actual CLDR name of 🎯), `idea`, `success`, `productivity`. Build a small per-call concept→stem lexicon before issuing searches.
- **Concept → known-good stem cheatsheet** (verified 2026-05-19):
  - idea / insight → `bulb` (💡), `brain` (🧠), `think` (🤔), `sparkle` (✨)
  - launch / start → `rocket` (🚀)
  - target / goal → `direct hit` (🎯 — slug is `direct-hit-emoji-copy-paste`, NOT `target`)
  - check / approve → `check` (✅ ☑️), `thumbs up`
  - celebrate / win → `party` (🎉🥳), `tada`, `clap`, `trophy`
  - email itself → `mail` (📧 e-mail, 📪📫📭📬 mailboxes), `envelope` (✉️📩📨)
  - team / collaboration → `handshake`, `people`, `family`
  - thanks → `pray`, `bow`, `heart`
  - calendar / scheduling → `calendar`, `clock`, `alarm clock` (⏰)
  - urgent / warning → `warning`, `siren`, `fire` (🔥)
- **URL slug naming uses Unicode CLDR short-names with spaces → hyphens.** "E-mail" is `/e-mail-emoji-copy-paste/` (note the hyphen _inside_ the name). "Light bulb" is `/light-bulb-emoji-copy-paste/`. "Direct hit" is `/direct-hit-emoji-copy-paste/`. Guess-and-fetch is risky for compound names; prefer search-then-follow over hand-crafting detail URLs.
- **The site is fully cached at the Cloudflare edge** (HTTP `Server: cloudflare`, `Cf-Cache-Status` present, content served from PDX POP in our trace). No rate-limiting observed on direct GETs from a sandbox IP at < 5 rps. No anti-bot challenge. No residential `proxy` or stealth session needed.
- **`data-clipboard-text` is the authoritative bytes.** Some emoji (variation-selector-16, skin-tone modifiers, flag regional-indicator pairs, ZWJ sequences like 👨‍👩‍👧) render as multiple Unicode codepoints. The `data-clipboard-text` attribute on the Copy button on each detail page is what the site itself puts on the clipboard — copy that string verbatim. Extracting from the visible `<span class="icon-item">…</span>` _also_ works but is one step further from the canonical source and risks dropping a VS16 if your HTML parser normalizes whitespace.
- **There is no `mailto:` or compose action on emojis.directory itself.** Anyone reading this skill expecting to "send" an email through the site is wrong — the skill's deliverable is text. The actual email-send must happen elsewhere (caller's MUA, an SES/Postmark API in the caller's stack, etc.) and is out of scope.
- **Don't waste turns on the Emoji Merge / Guess / Blog pages.** `/emoji-merge/` is a Genmoji-style toy (random-pair generator), `/guess/` is a game, `/blog/` is editorial — none expose emoji data in a structured way. Stick to search + detail + category.
- **`/emoji-keyboard/` is JS-rendered**, unlike everything else. The tag chips at the top (`<li class="keyboard-tag-select" data-tag="…">`) populate the grid only after a client-side click handler runs. Use a browser session if you must use this tool; otherwise prefer the static category pages (same data, no JS).
- **No emoji has CLDR name "idea" / "success" / "target" / "email" / "happy".** Be ready to fail-soft: when a search returns the no-results sentinel, fall back to a stem from the cheatsheet rather than retrying close variants.

  }
}
```

Alternative success shape — concept that hit the no-results path and required a stem fallback:

```json
{
  "concept": "target / goal",
  "query_used": "target",
  "search_result": "no_match",
  "fallback_query": "direct hit",
  "name": "direct hit",
  "emoji": "🎯",
  "slug_url": "https://emojis.directory/direct-hit-emoji-copy-paste/"
}
```
