# Pro-Football-Reference Player Stats

## Purpose

Given an NFL player reference (full PFR URL, PFR ID like `MahoPa00`, or free-form name) return the player's bio plus the requested stat tables — career, season-by-season, splits, and/or game log — as structured JSON. Each row preserves the verbatim PFR column headers, table id, and column order so downstream callers know the schema. Read-only: never click Subscribe, Stathead, login, or any account/mutation control; never submit a form.

## When to Use

- Pulling a player's career season-by-season stats for any stat scope (passing, rushing/receiving, defense, kicking, punting, returns, scoring, snap counts, advanced passing/rushing/receiving/defense, combine, draft).
- Building a career game log (per-game opponent, result, snaps, stat columns) for regular season, postseason, or both.
- Splits analysis (home/away, vs division, by down/quarter/red-zone, by week, …).
- Resolving a fuzzy player name plus team/year disambiguator to a canonical PFR ID.
- Backfilling structured NFL stats anywhere you'd otherwise scrape Sports-Reference HTML.

## Workflow

PFR has no public JSON API. Their entire surface (including `/robots.txt`) is fronted by Cloudflare with a JavaScript challenge — bare HTTP fetches (even through a residential proxy) return **403 "Just a moment…"** with a `__cf_bm` cookie and `cf-mitigated: challenge` header. **A stealth + residential-proxy browser session is mandatory.** Many tables are also wrapped in HTML comments (`<!-- <table …> -->`) so an extractor must read both the visible DOM and the comment nodes.

### 1. Stealth + residential-proxy session (mandatory)

Drive the whole nav → snapshot → extract flow inside a **single** `browserless_agent` call, passing a top-level `proxy: { "proxy": "residential", "proxyCountry": "us" }`. Keep every step below in that one call's `commands` array so the Cloudflare `__cf_bm` cookie stays together across navigations, and repeat the `proxy` arg on any follow-up call — the session is keyed by `proxy`, so repeating it reconnects to the same warmed session while dropping or changing it lands you in a different, bare (403'd) session.

The stealth browser + residential proxy are both required. A bare HTTP fetch (with or without a proxy) reliably 403s on PFR's Cloudflare challenge — verified 2026-05-18 on `/`, `/robots.txt`, `/players/M/MahoPa00.htm`, and the `pfref.com` short-link domain (which is the same Cloudflare tenant). The challenge wants real JS execution; once the stealth browser solves it, the `__cf_bm` cookie persists for ~30 min and subsequent requests in the same call are unchallenged.

### 2. Resolve the player to a canonical PFR ID

PFR IDs are formed as **first 4 letters of last name + first 2 letters of first name + 2-digit collision suffix** (`MahoPa00`, `BradTo00`, `RoetBe00`, `MannPe00`). When the input is:

- **Full URL** — extract the ID from the path: `/players/<Letter>/<PFR_ID>.htm`. Done; skip ahead.
- **Bare PFR ID** — construct the URL: `https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/<first-letter-of-last-name-UPPERCASE>/<PFR_ID>.htm`. The letter prefix path segment is **the first letter of the LAST name**, not the first character of the ID (the ID's first letter IS that, but the convention is anchored on the last name — e.g. Mahomes → `M/MahoPa00.htm`, Brady → `B/BradTo00.htm`).
- **Free-form name** — use PFR's player search endpoint `/search/search.fcgi?search=<urlenc-name>`. The HTML response either redirects to the canonical `/players/<L>/<id>.htm` page (single match) or renders a disambiguation list. The disambiguation page lists candidates as `<div class="search-item">` blocks with the player's name, team(s), and active year range. Surface the candidate list to the caller as `{success: false, reason: "ambiguous_name", candidates: [...]}` when there are 2+ top-tier matches; resolve automatically only when a single name+team disambiguator collapses to one row.
- **Fallback** when the search endpoint is rate-limited: the per-letter index pages at `/players/<UPPERCASE-LETTER>/` list every player whose last name starts with that letter. Match by substring on the rendered text + `<a href="/players/<L>/<id>.htm">` anchors.

### 3. Pick the right page for the requested scope

| Scope requested                            | Canonical URL                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bio + career season-by-season tables       | `/players/<L>/<id>.htm`                                                             |
| Per-season game log                        | `/players/<L>/<id>/gamelog/<YEAR>/`                                                 |
| Career game log (all seasons concatenated) | `/players/<L>/<id>/gamelog/`                                                        |
| Playoffs / Super Bowl game log             | `/players/<L>/<id>/gamelog/?post=1` or `/super-bowl/`                               |
| Splits (by season)                         | `/players/<L>/<id>/splits/<YEAR>/`                                                  |
| Touchdowns log                             | `/players/<L>/<id>/touchdowns/<scope>` (e.g. `passing`, `rushing`, `receiving`)     |
| Fantasy log                                | `/players/<L>/<id>/fantasy/<YEAR>/`                                                 |
| Combine                                    | `/players/<L>/<id>.htm` (combine table is embedded on the bio page when applicable) |
| Draft                                      | `/years/<YEAR>/draft.htm#drafts` (or embedded on bio page)                          |

For multi-scope requests, open the bio page once (it contains most career season-by-season tables) and only navigate to `/gamelog/` / `/splits/` when granularity demands it. Each navigation costs another Cloudflare warmup if the cookie expired.

### 4. Open the page and snapshot

```json
{ "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/<L>/<ID>.htm", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } }
{ "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 2000 } }
{ "method": "snapshot" }
```

`waitForTimeout` covers the late-arriving JS that injects sticky-table headers; the `snapshot` confirms the player banner refs are present. Verify the snapshot contains the player name as the page `<h1>` text (e.g. `heading "Patrick Mahomes"`). If the snapshot reads "Just a moment…" or "Verifying you are human" the Cloudflare challenge didn't complete — retry the `goto` after a `waitForTimeout` of 5000 ms. If it still fails, the session was flagged: start over with a fresh `browserless_agent` call.

### 5. Extract bio meta (always on the bio page, never comment-wrapped)

PFR exposes the player meta block as `<div id="meta">` near the top of the bio page. Read it with an `evaluate` command (the result comes back under `.value`):

```json
{
  "method": "evaluate",
  "params": {
    "content": "(() => { const m = document.getElementById('meta'); if (!m) return null; return JSON.stringify({ name: m.querySelector('h1 span')?.textContent || m.querySelector('h1')?.textContent, text: m.innerText }); })()"
  }
}
```

Parse from `m.innerText` (newline-separated lines): position(s), height/weight, DOB (linked to `/friv/birthdays.cgi`), birthplace, college, draft round/pick/year/team, HOF status, NFL team/year ranges. The text is consistent across players and is **not comment-wrapped** — read directly.

### 6. Extract stat tables (mix of visible-DOM and comment-wrapped)

**Critical PFR scraping pattern**: secondary stat tables are wrapped in HTML comments inside placeholder divs to defeat naive `document.querySelector('table#...')` calls:

```html
<div class="table_container is_setup" id="div_rushing_and_receiving">
  <!--
    <table class="row_summable sortable stats_table now_sortable" id="rushing_and_receiving">
      <thead>...</thead><tbody>...</tbody>
    </table>
  -->
</div>
```

PFR's own client-side JS un-comments these on load (after a 1-3 s delay) — so by the time the `snapshot` runs after the 2000 ms `waitForTimeout`, **most placeholder divs are already promoted** and the tables are queryable via plain DOM. But not always: some tables (advanced passing/rushing/receiving, snap counts on bio pages, splits sub-tables) ship un-promoted on initial load and only un-comment when their parent section becomes visible. Belt-and-suspenders extractor (run as the `content` of an `evaluate` command; `JSON.stringify` the `tables` object before returning it):

```javascript
// evaluate content — extract all stat tables, including those still in comment form
const tables = {};
// Visible DOM tables
document.querySelectorAll('table.stats_table[id]').forEach((t) => {
  tables[t.id] = parseTable(t);
});
// Comment-wrapped tables under placeholders
document
  .querySelectorAll('div.placeholder, div.table_container')
  .forEach((div) => {
    for (const node of div.childNodes) {
      if (
        node.nodeType === 8 /* COMMENT_NODE */ &&
        /<table[^>]+id=/i.test(node.nodeValue)
      ) {
        const tmp = document.createElement('div');
        tmp.innerHTML = node.nodeValue;
        tmp.querySelectorAll('table[id]').forEach((t) => {
          if (!tables[t.id]) tables[t.id] = parseTable(t);
        });
      }
    }
  });

function parseTable(t) {
  // Use the LAST <thead><tr> as the header row — PFR stacks an "over-header"
  // group row (e.g. "Passing | Rushing | …") above the real column-header row.
  const headRows = t.querySelectorAll('thead tr');
  const headTr = headRows[headRows.length - 1];
  const cols = [...headTr.querySelectorAll('th')].map(
    (th) => th.getAttribute('data-stat') || th.textContent.trim(),
  );
  const rows = [];
  for (const tr of t.querySelectorAll('tbody tr')) {
    if (tr.classList.contains('thead')) continue; // mid-table repeat-header rows
    const row = { _table: t.id, _stat_keys: {} };
    for (const cell of tr.children) {
      const key = cell.getAttribute('data-stat');
      const txt = cell.textContent.trim();
      if (key) row._stat_keys[key] = txt;
      row[
        cell.textContent.trim()
          ? cell.getAttribute('data-stat') || cell.textContent
          : '_'
      ] = txt;
    }
    rows.push(row);
  }
  return { id: t.id, columns: cols, rows };
}
```

Prefer `data-stat` attribute keys over visible-text headers — PFR uses stable machine-readable stat keys like `pass_cmp`, `pass_att`, `pass_yds`, `pass_td`, `pass_int`, `pass_rating`, `qbr`, `qbrec`, `rush_yds`, `rec`, `rec_yds`, `def_int`, `tackles_solo`, `snap_counts_offense`, `av`. The visible header text may collide (e.g. "Yds" appears for both passing yards and sack yards within one row); `data-stat` doesn't.

### 7. Known table ids per scope

| Stat scope (input)  | Table id(s) on bio page (`/players/<L>/<id>.htm`)                                                         |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| passing             | `passing` (visible)                                                                                       |
| advanced passing    | `passing_advanced` (comment-wrapped)                                                                      |
| rushing / receiving | `rushing_and_receiving` (comment-wrapped for skill-position players; visible for pure RBs)                |
| advanced rushing    | `rushing_advanced` (comment-wrapped)                                                                      |
| advanced receiving  | `receiving_advanced` (comment-wrapped)                                                                    |
| defense             | `defense` (visible for DBs/LBs)                                                                           |
| advanced defense    | `defense_advanced` (comment-wrapped)                                                                      |
| kicking             | `kicking` (visible)                                                                                       |
| punting             | `punting` (visible)                                                                                       |
| returns             | `returns` (visible)                                                                                       |
| scoring             | `scoring` (visible)                                                                                       |
| snap counts         | `snap_counts` (comment-wrapped)                                                                           |
| games played        | `games_played_team` (comment-wrapped)                                                                     |
| fantasy             | `fantasy` (comment-wrapped)                                                                               |
| combine             | `combine` (comment-wrapped if present — many players have no row)                                         |
| draft               | `draft` (in the meta block, not a separate table)                                                         |
| playoffs            | `passing_playoffs`, `rushing_and_receiving_playoffs`, `defense_playoffs`, etc. (each one comment-wrapped) |

Game-log pages (`/gamelog/[/<year>/]`) use ids `stats`, `stats_basic_nfl`, `stats_advanced_nfl`, `stats_playoffs`. Splits pages (`/splits/<year>/`) use ids like `stats` plus `splits` sub-tables labelled by the split type.

### 8. Per-game / per-16 / per-17 derived rows

PFR appends `Career`, `<N> seasons`, and per-game footer rows directly in `<tfoot>` of each season-by-season table. Detect by `tr.parentElement.tagName === 'TFOOT'` or by checking for an empty `data-stat="year_id"` on the first cell. Preserve these as separate footer rows (`_table_section: "tfoot"`) so callers can choose to pass them through or filter.

PFR doesn't emit per-game rate rows automatically for every stat. To get them client-side, divide totals by the `g_played` (or `g`) column from the same row. Per-16 / per-17 conversion is the caller's responsibility — PFR shows raw totals, not normalized.

### 9. Multi-position players, mid-career trades

A row's `team_name_abbr` (data-stat) may be `2TM` / `3TM` ("2 teams in same season") with a per-team breakdown immediately below. Don't drop the `2TM` summary row; preserve it as the canonical season total and the per-team rows as sub-rows (`_split_of_year: "2024"`).

### 10. Rate limit + politeness

PFR's robots.txt (when reachable) historically asked for **≥ 3 s between requests, 20 req/min cap** and a descriptive User-Agent. Cloudflare also rate-limits aggressive clients independently. Keep ≤ 1 req every 3 s sustained, fewer in parallel, and don't open 10+ pages from one session in rapid sequence — Cloudflare will gate the session on a JS-challenge re-prompt that the stealth bypass may not pass on retry.

### 11. No session-release step

There's nothing to release — there is no explicit session-release call. The session persists across calls keyed by `proxy`. Keep the full flow (nav → snapshot → extract, plus any `/gamelog/` or `/splits/` follow-up navigations) inside ONE call's `commands` array to save round-trips; a follow-up call carrying the same `proxy` reconnects to the same warmed session (Cloudflare `__cf_bm` cookie intact), while a call that drops or changes `proxy` lands in a different, bare session that re-runs the JS challenge.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **Cloudflare JS challenge on every path — verified 2026-05-18**. A bare HTTP fetch (with or without a residential proxy) returns 403 with `Just a moment…` HTML, `__cf_bm` cookie, `cf-mitigated: challenge` header, and a CSP listing `challenges.cloudflare.com`. This is true for `/`, `/robots.txt`, every `/players/…` path, AND the `pfref.com` short-link domain. **A stealth browser session is the only working path.**
- **Egress to the Browserless endpoint must be reachable**. If your environment restricts outbound network policy, `browserless_agent` calls will fail to connect before they ever reach PFR. That's an egress/network-policy wall on your side, not a PFR or Cloudflare block — surface it distinctly from a `cf-mitigated: challenge` 403.
- **HTML-comment-wrapped tables — PFR's signature defense.** Many tables (`rushing_and_receiving`, `passing_advanced`, `snap_counts`, `games_played_team`, all `*_playoffs` variants) live inside `<div class="placeholder|table_container">` blocks as raw HTML inside an HTML comment node. PFR's own JS un-comments them on load with a 1-3 s delay. After `goto` + a 2000 ms `waitForTimeout` most are promoted, but ALWAYS scan comment children of placeholder/table_container divs as a fallback. Naive `querySelector('table#snap_counts')` will miss them on first paint.
- **Two `<thead>` rows per table — use the second.** Most stats tables stack an "over-header" group row (e.g. `Passing | Rushing | Receiving`) above the actual column-header row. Extract from `thead tr:last-child`, not `thead tr`.
- **`data-stat` is the stable column key, not the visible header.** Header text duplicates within a row (`Yds` for both passing yards and sack yards on a passing row). Use the `data-stat` attribute on each `<th>`/`<td>` (e.g. `pass_yds`, `pass_sacked_yds`, `qbr`, `rate`, `any_a`, `rush_ybc`, `rec_yac`, `def_int`, `snap_counts_offense_pct`).
- **Mid-table repeat header rows have `class="thead"`** — skip them, they're rendered as part of `<tbody>` but contain the same labels as the header row.
- **`<tfoot>` carries Career / per-game / N seasons aggregates** — keep them flagged as footer rows (`_table_section: "tfoot"`); don't merge them into the season rows.
- **Multi-team season → `2TM` / `3TM` summary row + per-team sub-rows**. Preserve both; downstream callers want either depending on the question.
- **PFR ID letter prefix is the FIRST letter of the LAST name (uppercase).** Mahomes → `/players/M/MahoPa00.htm`, Brady → `/players/B/BradTo00.htm`. The ID itself starts with the same letter, but anchor on the last name when constructing URLs from a name input.
- **Player-search endpoint redirects on single match, paginates on multi**. `/search/search.fcgi?search=<q>` 302s to `/players/<L>/<id>.htm` when one player matches; otherwise returns a `<div class="search-item">` list of all candidates. Drive your disambiguation logic off the response status — a 200 with no redirect means "more than one match".
- **`/players/<L>/<id>/touchdowns/<scope>` exists** for passing/rushing/receiving TDs as a per-TD log (date, quarter, distance, opponent). Useful if the caller wants TD-level granularity, but the row count is large for long careers — only fetch when explicitly requested.
- **Game logs split regular-season vs playoffs by URL param**. `/gamelog/` shows regular-season; `/gamelog/?post=1` (or the table id `stats_playoffs` on the same page when the player has playoff games) shows postseason. For "both", read the same page and capture both table ids.
- **Splits live on a separate page per season** — there's no all-time splits view. Caller asking for "career red-zone splits" requires N requests, one per season. Be deliberate about rate limit.
- **Active-season stats lag a few hours**. PFR pulls from official feeds with a delay; for in-progress games the row may be missing or show stale totals. Document the page's "Last updated" footer timestamp when present.
- **Stathead / `pfref.com` is paywalled** — same Cloudflare tenant, same 403 on bare fetch, but even with the stealth bypass the content sits behind a subscription gate. **Do not** click "Subscribe", "Stathead", or any login/account control. The skill is read-only on the public PFR surface.
- **No public JSON API exists** — confirmed across multiple iterations. There are private XHR endpoints feeding the rendered tables but they require the Cloudflare-issued session cookie and a CSRF-like signed request; don't waste time trying to call them directly. The DOM extraction path is the canonical mechanism.
- **Alternative pre-extracted data sources** (when fresh-scrape isn't required and the caller wants bulk historicals): `nflverse-data` GitHub releases (https://github.com/nflverse/nflverse-data/releases — reachable from sandbox without Cloudflare) ship CSV/parquet aggregations of PFR + other sources, refreshed weekly during the season. Faster and cheaper than scraping, but lags by ~24 h and is community-maintained, so cross-check before quoting.
