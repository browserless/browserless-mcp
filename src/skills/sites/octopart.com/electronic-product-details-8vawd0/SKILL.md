# Octopart Electronic Product Search

## Purpose

Search Octopart's catalog of electronic components by keyword, part number, or technical spec, and return a clean JSON object containing each matching part's identity (MPN + manufacturer), specs, distributor availability, and current pricing tiers across distributors (DigiKey, Mouser, Arrow, Avnet, Farnell, etc.). Read-only — never adds to cart, never submits orders.

## When to Use

- Engineer/buyer needs to compare prices for an MPN (e.g. `LM358`, `STM32F103C8T6`, `ERJ-2RKF1002X`) across 30+ authorized distributors in one query.
- Sourcing automation that decides which distributor to procure from based on current stock + price-break tiers.
- Component cross-reference: given an MPN, find alternatives + their pricing.
- BOM pricing rollups when you have a list of MPNs and need unit cost + stock at quantity break.
- Any flow that would otherwise scrape `octopart.com/search?q=...` HTML — the Nexar GraphQL API is faster, structurally cleaner, and is the only path that reliably bypasses Octopart's PerimeterX (PX) bot wall.

## Workflow

Octopart's public web UI (`/search`, `/electronic-parts/...`, `/part/{mfr-slug}/{mpn}`) is fronted by PerimeterX human-challenge — verified blocked across a plain `browserless_agent` session, a stealth + residential-proxy session, and fresh-session direct-to-detail navigation (4 iterations, all PX-walled). **The supported path is the Nexar API.** Altium operates Octopart's data as the public face of the Nexar GraphQL API at `https://api.nexar.com/graphql` — same dataset, no PX. The Nexar API is free for low volume after registering an application; OAuth2 client credentials are required.

### 1. One-time setup: register a Nexar API application

1. Sign up at `https://nexar.com/` (free).
2. Go to `https://portal.nexar.com/` → Applications → New Application.
3. Pick the **Supply** scope (`supply.domain`) — this scope grants the Octopart product-search/pricing queries (`supSearch`, `supSearchMpn`, `supParts`).
4. Copy `clientId` and `clientSecret` — store these in your agent's secret store, **not** in the SKILL.md or task input.

### 2. Acquire an OAuth2 access token

```bash
TOKEN=$(curl -sS -X POST https://identity.nexar.com/connect/token \
  -d "grant_type=client_credentials" \
  -d "client_id=${NEXAR_CLIENT_ID}" \
  -d "client_secret=${NEXAR_CLIENT_SECRET}" \
  -d "scope=supply.domain" \
  | node -e "let s='';process.stdin.on('data',c=>s+=c).on('end',()=>process.stdout.write(JSON.parse(s).access_token))")
```

Tokens are valid for ~24 hours. Cache and reuse — don't request a new one per query.

### 3. Run the search query

For a free-text search ("LM358", "10nf,25v,10%,X7R,0402", or "STM32" partial MPN), use `supSearch`:

```graphql
query SearchProducts($q: String!, $limit: Int = 10) {
  supSearch(q: $q, limit: $limit, inStockOnly: false) {
    hits
    results {
      part {
        id
        mpn
        manufacturer {
          name
        }
        shortDescription
        category {
          name
          path
        }
        bestDatasheet {
          url
        }
        bestImage {
          url
        }
        medianPrice1000 {
          price
          currency
        }
        specs {
          attribute {
            shortname
            name
            group
          }
          displayValue
        }
        sellers {
          company {
            name
          }
          country
          offers {
            sku
            inventoryLevel
            moq
            packaging
            clickUrl
            prices {
              quantity
              price
              currency
            }
            updated
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For a guaranteed exact-MPN match (no fuzzy expansion), use `supSearchMpn` with the same selection set — it returns 1 hit per exact MPN.

POST to the GraphQL endpoint:

```bash
curl -sS -X POST https://api.nexar.com/graphql \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"query\": \"...above...\", \"variables\": {\"q\": \"LM358\", \"limit\": 5}}"
```

### 4. Reshape the response into the clean JSON contract

Map each `results[].part` into the output shape under `## Expected Output`. Key rules:

- **Sort offers within a seller** by `prices[0].quantity` ascending — the API doesn't guarantee order.
- **Pick the lowest-quantity-1 price across all sellers** as the "best price" rollup field. If a seller's lowest tier is `quantity > 1`, fall back to their lowest tier.
- **Drop `inventoryLevel: 0` offers** unless `include_out_of_stock: true` was requested.
- **Normalize all prices to USD** if needed — Nexar returns prices in the seller's listed currency. `medianPrice1000` is pre-normalized in USD for the "best estimate" rollup.

### Browser fallback

**Not viable via a browser session.** PerimeterX (`/kdRQnL15/` proxying endpoints in `robots.txt` confirms the deployment) issues a "Press & Hold Human Challenge" iframe on every non-homepage request, including:

- `/search?q=...` — blocked on a plain session, blocked on stealth + residential proxy
- `/electronic-parts/{category}` — blocked
- `/part/{manufacturer-slug}/{mpn}` — blocked even via direct navigation on a brand-new session

A raw HTTP fetch (e.g. a `browserless_function` that navigates to the origin then `page.evaluate`s a same-origin `fetch`) does receive real HTML (no PX challenge), but part-detail pages are ~1.5-3 MB and the text return is ~200k-char capped, so project in-page. The JSON-LD `<script type="application/ld+json">` block embedded in `/part/{mfr}/{mpn}` carries the `Product` schema.org graph with `name`, `mpn`, `brand`, `offers[].price`, `offers[].priceCurrency`, `offers[].availability`, `offers[].seller` — parse that (in-page) instead of the visual DOM. Note this yields only the headline qty=1 price; per-tier breaks remain API-only, so for pricing prefer the Nexar API.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **PerimeterX is universally deployed on data pages.** Verified 2026-05-19 across 4 iterations: `/search?q=LM358` returned `Block Type: PX, Reference: a0af2040-5340-...` on a plain `browserless_agent` session, on a stealth + residential-proxy session (residential proxy IP `108.41.189.122`, also blocked), and on a fresh stealth session navigating _directly_ to `/part/te-connectivity/66105-3`. The homepage `/` is the **only** universally-reachable page on the first request of a session.
- **The PX flag is sticky to the session.** Once any data page is challenged, subsequent loads (even of `/`) on the same session return PX too. There is no recovery within a session — release and create a new one, but the new one will still block at `/search`.
- **Don't waste iterations on selectors/CSS for `/search`.** No selector strategy survives the challenge iframe. The skill exits at the PX wall, not at a render race.
- **A raw HTTP fetch bypasses PX** (different fingerprint than headless Chrome), but Octopart part-detail pages are ~1.5-3 MB of JS-rendered HTML + inline JSON, so you must slice/project in-page (the text return is ~200k-char capped) rather than shipping the whole document. The sitemap index (`product-sitemap-index.xml`) and `robots.txt` are small and return cleanly — useful for enumerating MPN coverage but they contain no pricing data.
- **`/part/{old-mpn-slug}-{numeric-id}` 301-redirects to `/part/{mfr-slug}/{mpn}`** — both URL forms resolve to the same detail page. The newer canonical form is `/part/{mfr-slug}/{mpn}`.
- **Nexar API rate limits**: free tier is ~1,000 queries/month and ~20 QPS. For a single search-and-extract this is generous; for daily BOM pricing across hundreds of MPNs, request a paid tier or batch via `supParts(ids: [...])`.
- **Nexar OAuth2 endpoint is `identity.nexar.com`, not `api.nexar.com`.** Common mistake — the GraphQL endpoint and the token endpoint live on different subdomains.
- **`supSearch` does fuzzy MPN expansion.** Searching `STM32` returns ~10k hits across the STM32 family — use `supSearchMpn` for exact MPN, or pass `filters: { manufacturer_id: { eq: <id> } }` to narrow.
- **`medianPrice1000` is null for many parts** — it's an aggregate that requires enough distributor signal. Fall back to the lowest `sellers[].offers[].prices[]` tier when computing a "current price" field.
- **`sellers[].offers[].prices[]` is per quantity break.** A single seller may list 5–8 quantity breaks (1, 10, 100, 1000, 5000, 10000). Always pass through all tiers in the output, then surface a `best_unit_price` rollup at qty=1 for convenience.
- **`inventoryLevel` of `null` ≠ 0.** `null` means the distributor didn't report stock to Octopart; `0` is reported zero. Treat them differently when filtering for available parts.
- **Octopart was acquired by Altium and rolled into the Nexar product family in 2018.** Some older support docs (pre-2020) reference an `octopart.com/api/v3/...` REST API — that surface is now deprecated, `robots.txt` Disallows `/api/v1/*` through `/api/v4/*`, and the v3 keys no longer authenticate. The Nexar GraphQL endpoint is the only supported programmatic surface today.

If the browser-fallback path is ever unblocked (PX softens or the Fetch API cap is raised), the same shape is reconstructible from the `<script type="application/ld+json">` `Product` block on `/part/{mfr-slug}/{mpn}` — `name → mpn`, `brand.name → manufacturer`, `description → short_description`, `offers[].price/.priceCurrency/.availability/.seller.name → sellers[].offers[].prices[0]`. The browser path will NOT yield per-quantity break tiers (only the headline qty=1 price is in JSON-LD) — that's an API-only capability.

If the query yields zero hits:

```json
{
  "query": "totally-fake-mpn-123",
  "method": "nexar-api",
  "hits": 0,
  "results": []
}
```

If the Nexar token request fails (bad credentials, scope mismatch):

```json
{
  "query": "LM358",
  "method": "nexar-api",
  "error": "auth_failed",
  "detail": "invalid_client"
}
```
