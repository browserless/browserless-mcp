      Two public profile pages render the same data with no anti-bot wall:
      https://operator.fyi/biz/{slug}/ (brain dashboard) and
      https://operator.fyi/{niche}/{city_slug}/{slug}/ (vertical listing with

# Operator Business Brain Profile

## Purpose

Resolve a free-text business reference (name, website domain, city, or trade) into a single structured "Brain profile" from Operator's public substrate of 35.2M US local businesses. Returns: brain score (0–100) with six weighted components, market position (rank within city + trade), recent review sentiment aggregated from Google/Yelp/Meta, services + contact info (phone/address public; email privacy-protected), top 3 same-market competitors with brain scores only, the AI-generated `why` narrative, the `operator_estimate_low/mid/high` valuation band (USD, vertical-aware multiple drawn from Operator's own broker comparables — they cite Empire Flippers / Flippa / BizBuySell on the marketing page), the canonical `/biz/{slug}/` URL, and the per-business MCP descriptor URL at `/mcp/biz/{slug}/`. Read-only — no booking, claiming, or activation calls.

## When to Use

- A user pastes a business name, website URL, or `"plumber in austin"`-style phrase and wants the full Operator dossier.
- An agent needs a single JSON view of a local-services business before deciding to recommend, contact, or compare it.
- A downstream MCP-aware client needs the per-business tool/resource manifest at `/mcp/biz/{slug}/` to delegate further calls.
- Lightweight competitive benchmarking: top-3 same-trade-same-city peers with brain scores and valuation bands.
- ARR / valuation estimation for SMB acquisition research (the `operator_estimate_*` fields are the vertical-multiple band).

## Workflow

Operator exposes a stable, **unauthenticated** REST API at `https://operator.fyi/api/v1/` with a 100 req/day free-tier ceiling, no key required (see `https://operator.fyi/developers/` and OpenAPI 3.0.3 spec at `https://operator.fyi/api/v1/openapi.json`). The full brain profile is assembled from five GET calls in parallel after slug resolution. **Do not drive a browser for this task** — the same data backs the rendered `/biz/{slug}/` and `/{niche}/{city_slug}/{slug}/` pages and there is no anti-bot wall in front of the API.

1. **Resolve free-text input to a slug.** Hit `GET https://operator.fyi/api/v1/recommend/?query={url-encoded-text}`. The response auto-detects `niche` + `city` + `state` and returns up to 3 `recommendations` with `name`, `rating`, `reviews`, `phone`, `address`, `url` (the vertical listing URL — derive the slug from the trailing path segment), `trust_score`, and a one-sentence `why` (this is the AI narrative the task asks for). If the caller supplied a slug already, skip this step.
2. **Fetch the canonical profile.** `GET /api/v1/business/?slug={slug}` → `data` contains `id` (UUID), `name`, `slug`, `niche`, `city`, `city_slug`, `state`, `address`, `phone`, `website`, `rating`, `review_count`, `description` (the long-form AI narrative blurb), `services[]`, `photos[]`, `business_hours`, `claimed`, `listing_url`, `google_maps_url`, `same_as[]`. Note `data.reviews` is an empty array in the free tier — review _text_ is gated; aggregate sentiment is not.
3. **Fetch brain score.** `GET /api/v1/health-score/?slug={slug}` → `data.overall_score` (0–100), `data.grade` (A-F), and `data.components` with six weighted sub-scores: `trust_layer` (0.20), `review_signal` (0.25), `market_position` (0.20), `digital_presence` (0.20), `demand_signal` (0.15). This is the MCP-canonical brain score — the `get_brain_score` MCP tool resolves to exactly this endpoint.
4. **Fetch market position.** `GET /api/v1/market-position/?slug={slug}` → `data.rank`, `data.total_in_market`, `data.percentile`, `data.composite_score`, plus market-average rating / review-count / years-in-business and `gap_to_next_rank.advice` (a short coaching string). Use this for the "market position rank within (city, trade)" field.
5. **Fetch review intelligence.** `GET /api/v1/review-intelligence/?slug={slug}` → `data.overall_sentiment` (`very_positive` | `positive` | `mixed` | `negative` | `very_negative`), `data.rating_distribution` (1–5 star counts), `data.themes[]` (theme extraction; often empty on unclaimed listings — see Gotchas), `data.market_comparison` (your-vs-market rating + review-count + verdict strings like `"above"` / `"below"`).
6. **Fetch peer set + valuation band.** `GET /api/v1/markets/{city_slug}/{niche}/` returns `businesses[]` (up to ~50, sorted by Operator's own ranking). For each business you get `id`, `name`, `slug`, `rating`, `review_count`, `market_rank` (often `null` while indexing — see Gotchas), `operator_verified_score` (this is the publicly-exposed brain score per peer), and three valuation fields: `operator_estimate_low`, `operator_estimate_mid`, `operator_estimate_high` (USD, vertical-multiple). To build "top 3 competitors": find the queried business by slug, drop it from the array, take the next 3 highest-`operator_verified_score` (fall back to highest rating × log(reviews) if scores are null), and emit only `{ name, slug, brain_score, canonical_url }` — no detailed intel, per the task contract. The queried business's own row carries its valuation band — store `{ low, mid, high }`.
7. **Construct canonical URL + MCP endpoint.** Canonical: `https://operator.fyi/biz/{slug}/` (always — verify with `HEAD` if paranoid). Per-business MCP descriptor: `https://operator.fyi/mcp/biz/{slug}/` returns JSON with `mcp.server.url` (`https://operator.fyi/api/mcp-v2`), `mcp.tools[]` (4 tools incl. `scan_business`, `get_brain_score`, `claim_business`, `get_review_intelligence`), `mcp.resources[]` (links back to business_profile, market_rankings, public_profile_html), and `mcp.prompts[]` (3 pre-built prompts). Pass that URL through to the caller so downstream MCP clients can mount it directly.
8. **Emit one JSON object** matching the Expected Output schema. ARR-with-confidence-band is _not_ an explicit field anywhere in the Operator API — derive it (or omit it) from `operator_estimate_mid` divided by a vertical-typical revenue multiple (1.5–3× ARR for service trades on BizBuySell / Empire Flippers comparables); flag confidence as `low` when `operator_estimate_mid` is null or when `health-score.components.demand_signal` is 0. Be explicit in the output that ARR is _derived_, not directly returned by Operator.

### Browser fallback

If the API is degraded (the `/api/v1/search/` index falls back to `supabase_timeout_then_fallback_http_500` intermittently — see Gotchas), open one of the two public profile pages and screenshot/extract:

- `https://operator.fyi/biz/{slug}/` — modern "Brain dashboard" with 6-segment radial, profile completeness 0–100, brain level L0–L6, `operator://...` activity ledger.
- `https://operator.fyi/{niche}/{city_slug}/{slug}/` — long-form vertical listing with full health-score component breakdown, top-5 competitor leaderboard already rendered, services / specialties / certifications / service areas. The `listing_url` returned by `/api/v1/business` points here.

Both render server-side, no anti-bot wall, no JS execution needed for content. Use Browserbase only if you need pixel screenshots; otherwise a direct HTTP fetch is sufficient.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **Every `/api/v1/*` path requires a trailing slash.** Hitting `https://operator.fyi/api/v1/business?slug=X` returns a 308 redirect to `/api/v1/business/?slug=X` and (worse) the redirect Location URL-encodes the query string a second time, so a naive client follow can produce a 400. Always include the trailing slash explicitly.
- **`/api/v1/businesses/` (the plural list endpoint) returns `500 Internal server error` as of 2026-05-19**, regardless of filters. Use `/api/v1/recommend/` or `/api/v1/markets/{city_slug}/{niche}/` for list-style needs.
- **`/api/v1/search/?q=...` is flaky** — falls back to `search_index_fallback` with `fallback_reason: "supabase_timeout_then_fallback_http_500"` and `results: []` for queries that have working `/recommend` matches. Prefer `/recommend?query=...` as the slug-resolver; only use `/search` for known-exact name matches and treat empty results as transient.
- **`/api/v1/competitors/?slug=X` returns `{"ok": true, "gated": true, "unlocked": true, "content": null}` on the free tier** — confirmed null even with a valid slug. Don't waste calls on it; derive competitors from `/api/v1/markets/{city_slug}/{niche}/` instead.
- **Three different "brain"/"health" scores can appear for the same business.** `/api/v1/health-score` is the MCP-canonical one (52 for Roto-Rooter on 2026-05-19). The `/biz/{slug}/` HTML dashboard shows a _separate_ "BRAIN" number derived from profile completeness + ledger activity (75 for the same business). The `/{niche}/{city_slug}/{slug}/` listing page shows a _third_ "Health score" snapshot with its own component breakdown (98 in the same window). For programmatic use, **trust `/api/v1/health-score`**; cite the date stamp on the listing page if you need a human-friendly grade.
- **`market_rank` in `/api/v1/markets/...` is frequently `null`** ("Unranked" on the HTML, "Market rank refreshing") even for #1-by-`composite_score` businesses. Use `/api/v1/market-position?slug=X`'s `rank` + `total_in_market` + `percentile` for the rank field instead; that endpoint always computes a synthetic rank from the composite score.
- **`data.reviews: []` is by-design on the free tier** — Operator gates the full review text behind an enrichment key. `/api/v1/review-intelligence/` still returns aggregate sentiment + rating distribution + market comparison, which is what the task actually asks for. Don't interpret the empty array as "no reviews exist".
- **Contact email is intentionally privacy-protected.** `data.email` is never returned by `/api/v1/business/`; the HTML profile shows "Contact this business" instead of an address. Phone + street address are public. The skill output should mirror this: emit `phone` + `address` but leave `email` as `null` or omit it.
- **Two public profile URLs both work and both look canonical.** `/biz/{slug}/` (brain dashboard) and `/{niche}/{city_slug}/{slug}/` (vertical listing). The task spec says canonical is `/biz/{slug}/`; the API's `listing_url` field returns the vertical-listing form. Emit `/biz/{slug}/` as `canonical_url` and the vertical form as `listing_url` to satisfy both.
- **The `/mcp/biz/{slug}` endpoint also needs a trailing slash** (308 redirect otherwise). The returned manifest references `https://operator.fyi/api/mcp-v2` (a different server URL than `/api/mcp` used on the marketing page) — pass through whatever the per-business endpoint returns rather than hard-coding.
- **No authentication, no key, no signup** — the 100 req/day free-tier ceiling is per-IP. The full brain-profile assemble for one business is 5–6 GETs; budget accordingly when batch-processing.
- **`operator_estimate_*` is a USD _valuation_ band, not ARR**, despite the field naming. Roto-Rooter's mid was $9.78M with low $6.5M / high $13M on 2026-05-19 — that's a sale-price comparable, not an annual-revenue figure. The task asks for both ARR and valuation; only valuation is directly served. If you must emit ARR, derive it (`operator_estimate_mid / 2.0` is a reasonable vertical-blind midpoint for service trades) and tag the confidence band as `derived` / `low`.
- **`operator_estimate_*` is `null` for many listings** (~25% of the Honolulu plumbing peer set on 2026-05-19, including `Waialae Plumbing & Construction`). When null, emit `valuation_range: null` rather than fabricating a band.

### Outcome shape variants

- **`not_found`** — `/api/v1/recommend/` returns `recommendations: []` AND `/api/v1/search/` returns `results: []` (not a transient `supabase_timeout` fallback — verify by retrying once). Emit `{ "status": "not_found", "query": "<original input>" }` and nothing else.
- **`ambiguous_match`** — `/api/v1/recommend/` returns 2+ recommendations with similar `why` strings. Return all candidates as `{ "status": "ambiguous", "candidates": [ {name, slug, city, niche, rating}, ... ] }` and let the caller disambiguate.
- **`valuation_unavailable`** — business exists but `operator_estimate_low/mid/high` are all `null` in the markets payload. Emit the full profile but set `valuation_range: null` and `arr_estimate: null`. Do not fabricate.
- **`gated_intel`** — `/api/v1/competitors/` and `/api/v1/business`-side enrichment fields return `gated: true, content: null`. This is the free-tier default and not an error. Surface competitor data from `/api/v1/markets/{city_slug}/{niche}/` instead and proceed.
