# Xero Login

## Purpose

Authenticate a user session against Xero's accounting platform — either via the proper OAuth 2.0 / OIDC flow (recommended, supported, and TOS-compliant) or, as a fallback, by scripting the password form at `https://login.xero.com/identity/user/login`. This skill documents the login surface itself: canonical URL, form schema, anti-bot stack, branch outcomes (MFA, SSO, passkey, lockout, invalid creds), and the post-login redirect. It is the foundation skill that any other Xero in-app skill (`view-invoices`, `reconcile-transactions`, etc.) plugs into. Read-only with respect to the documentation contract — the skill never persists credentials and never modifies account state — but the act of logging in itself is the one Xero action this skill performs.

## When to Use

- You are building a Xero integration and need to know **which authentication path to take** (almost always: OAuth 2.0, not scripted login).
- An upstream skill needs an authenticated `go.xero.com` session and you need to script password login because OAuth isn't available (e.g. agent acting on behalf of itself with its own user account, internal staff tooling).
- You hit Akamai 403 / `_abck` / Access Denied on `login.xero.com` and need to know what cookies + session config you actually need.
- A login attempt produced an unexpected branch (locked, SSO redirect, passkey ceremony) and you need to identify which DOM hook to read.
- You're documenting the auth surface for a downstream agent that doesn't have access to Xero's developer docs.

## Workflow

The honest path for any third-party integration is **OAuth 2.0 / OIDC authorization-code with PKCE** against Xero's public identity server. Scripted password login violates Xero's third-party developer TOS, breaks on MFA-enabled accounts, breaks on SSO-bound accounts, breaks on passkey-bound accounts, and walks straight into Akamai Bot Manager. Lead with OAuth. Reserve scripted login for the narrow case where you have direct user credentials and no developer-app option.

### Recommended — OAuth 2.0 / OIDC

1. **Register an app** at `https://developer.xero.com/myapps/` to obtain `client_id` + `client_secret`. Choose "Web app" for confidential clients or "Mobile or desktop" for PKCE-only.

2. **Discover endpoints** from the public OIDC discovery doc (verified 2026-05-18, 200 OK, `application/json`, 1.3 KB):

   ```
   GET https://login.xero.com/identity/.well-known/openid-configuration
   ```

   Fields you'll use:

   | Field                      | Value                                                                             |
   | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | `issuer`                   | `https://identity.xero.com`                                                       |
   | `authorization_endpoint`   | `https://login.xero.com/identity/connect/authorize`                               |
   | `token_endpoint`           | `https://login.xero.com/identity/connect/token`                                   |
   | `userinfo_endpoint`        | `https://login.xero.com/identity/connect/userinfo`                                |
   | `end_session_endpoint`     | `https://login.xero.com/identity/connect/endsession`                              |
   | `response_types_supported` | `code`, `token`, `id_token`, `code id_token`, `code token`, `code id_token token` |

3. **Redirect the user** to `authorization_endpoint` with `client_id`, `response_type=code`, `redirect_uri`, `scope=openid profile email offline_access <accounting.*>`, `state`, and (for PKCE) `code_challenge` + `code_challenge_method=S256`. The user logs in on their own device — Xero handles MFA, SSO, and passkey internally. Your app never sees the password.

4. **Exchange the code** at `token_endpoint` (`grant_type=authorization_code`) for `access_token` + `refresh_token` + `id_token`. Persist the refresh token; use it to mint new access tokens for the next 60 days without re-prompting the user.

5. **Use the access token** as `Authorization: Bearer …` against `https://api.xero.com/api.xro/2.0/…` for accounting endpoints, or against `userinfo_endpoint` to identify the user. Refresh proactively — access tokens last 30 minutes.

That's the entire flow. No browser automation. No Akamai. No MFA scripting. No TOS exposure.

### Browser fallback — scripted password login

Use this only when OAuth is genuinely unavailable. Akamai Bot Manager and a client-side `browsercheck.xero.com` fingerprint are both active, so the whole flow should run in **one** `browserless_agent` call with a **residential proxy** — one call holds cookies across the GET → JS-fingerprint → POST round-trip with no chance of dropping the session config. The session does persist across separate calls (keyed by `proxy`/`profile`), so a follow-up call carrying the **same** `proxy` reconnects to the same session with the antiforgery/Akamai cookie pair intact; dropping or changing the `proxy` lands you in a different, blank session that must re-run the Akamai + browsercheck warm-up. Load the `autonomous-login` skill first (via `browserless_skill`) and follow its gates; supply the member's credentials with `loadSecret` (never in a `type` command or the context).

1. **Set a residential proxy on the call** (repeat it on every `browserless_agent` call in this flow):

   ```jsonc
   // top-level browserless_agent arg
   "proxy": { "proxy": "residential" }
   ```

   Without a residential IP + stealth, the GET returns 403 with an Akamai `Access Denied` page — verified 2026-05-18 from a sandbox IP not on Akamai's allowlist.

2. **Navigate to the canonical login URL** (the bare host 301-redirects here, so go direct):

   ```jsonc
   // browserless_agent commands
   { "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "https://login.xero.com/identity/user/login", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } },
   { "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 3000 } }   // let browsercheck.xero.com flip PreCheckCompleted to "true"
   ```

3. **Check for pre-form branches** before typing anything. Run `{ "method": "snapshot" }` and look for these refs:

   - `#xl-connected-passkey-use-password-instead-link` visible → a passkey ceremony is auto-firing. Click this button first; agent automation cannot satisfy WebAuthn.
   - `#xl-connected-sso-account-text` visible → the account is SSO-bound (enterprise tenant). Submit button text is "Log in with SSO" (per the `xl-strings` config block: `SSO_LOGIN_BUTTON_TEXT`). Submission will 302 to the corporate IdP; you can't proceed with username/password.
   - `#xl-locked-out` visible (no class `xui-u-hidden`) → previous failed-attempts ran the account into a 15-minute lockout. Stop and wait.

4. **Fill the form** (creds via `loadSecret`, not literal `text`):

   ```jsonc
   // browserless_agent commands
   { "method": "type",  "params": { "selector": "#xl-form-email",    "text": "<email-from-loadSecret>" } },
   { "method": "type",  "params": { "selector": "#xl-form-password", "text": "<password-from-loadSecret>" } },
   { "method": "click", "params": { "selector": "#xl-form-submit" } },
   { "method": "waitForNavigation", "params": { "waitUntil": "load" } }
   ```

   Field IDs and automation IDs verified 2026-05-18:

   | DOM ID              | `name`                   | `data-automationid`   |
   | ------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------- |
   | `#xl-form-email`    | `Username`               | `Username--input`     |
   | `#xl-form-password` | `Password`               | `PassWord--input`     |
   | `#xl-form-submit`   | `button` (value `login`) | `LoginSubmit--button` |

   **Do not POST the form manually with curl unless you carry every cookie + hidden field.** The form requires:
   - `__RequestVerificationToken` (hidden input, must match the `.AspNetCore.Antiforgery.<id>` cookie set on the GET).
   - `PreCheckCompleted=true` (hidden input that JS flips after `browsercheck.xero.com` returns a passing fingerprint).
   - `_abck`, `bm_sz`, `ak_bmsc` cookies (Akamai).
   - `Device` cookie (5-year fingerprint).

5. **Detect the outcome** by reading the post-submission state:

   - Page URL changed to `https://identity.xero.com/account/two-step-authentication` (or similar `/account/...verify...`): success, MFA required. You need the user's TOTP — the agent cannot proceed without it.
   - Page URL changed to `https://go.xero.com/...`: success, trusted device, MFA skipped. You are logged in.
   - Page URL changed to `ReturnUrl` you supplied (e.g. an OAuth callback at `/identity/connect/authorize/callback?...`): success, deep-link delivered.
   - Page is still on `/identity/user/login`, `#xl-invalid-username-or-password` now visible: credentials wrong. Error text: "Your email or password is incorrect".
   - Page is still on `/identity/user/login`, `#xl-locked-out` now visible: account just got locked out. Error text: "Your account has been locked due to repeated failed login attempts. Please wait for 15 minutes before trying again."

6. **Persist the session cookies** if downstream skills need them. The post-login `.AspNetCore.Identity.*` and `Xero.*` cookies are scoped to `*.xero.com` and required by `go.xero.com`. A `browserless_agent` session persists across calls, keyed by `proxy`/`profile` — a later call carrying the **same** `proxy` reconnects to the logged-in session with cookies intact, so you can either keep downstream `go.xero.com` work **in the same call's `commands` array** right after the successful login, or make a follow-up call with the same `proxy` to continue. Only dropping or changing the `proxy` lands you in a different, logged-out session that pays the full Akamai + browsercheck restart cost; capturing the login cookies (via `evaluate`/`cookies`) and replaying them is the fallback for that case.

7. **No session-release step** — there is nothing to release. The session persists across calls keyed by `proxy`/`profile` rather than dying on return.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **OAuth 2.0 is the right answer.** Xero's developer terms explicitly disallow scripting end-user password login for third-party integrations. Every other gotcha below is a consequence of doing this the hard way.
- **`https://login.xero.com/` 301-redirects to `/identity/user/login`.** Don't waste a network hop — go direct.
- **Akamai Bot Manager is active on every response.** Cookies set on the first GET: `_abck` (1-year), `bm_sz` (4-hour), `ak_bmsc` (2-hour, HttpOnly). Without a residential IP + stealth, the GET returns 403 with the Akamai `Access Denied` page. Verified 2026-05-18 — a request with a residential `proxy` from the route's sandbox IP succeeded with 200 OK.
- **`PreCheckCompleted` hidden field is a client-side gate.** Its initial value is `"false"`. The login JS bundle (`https://edge.xero.com/identity/login/login.<hash>.js`) calls `browsercheck.xero.com` to perform a TLS/canvas/font fingerprint, then flips the field to `"true"`. The server rejects POSTs with `PreCheckCompleted=false`. Real browser session: the flip happens within ~1 second after page load. Headless/curl scripted POSTs need to wait for this — a `{ "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 3000 } }` after the `goto` (waitUntil load) is the safe pattern. Curling the form directly with no JS execution will not work.
- **`__RequestVerificationToken` is bound to the session cookie.** It's an ASP.NET Core antiforgery token. The hidden form input value MUST match the `.AspNetCore.Antiforgery.<id>` cookie that was set on the GET. Re-fetching the form invalidates the prior pair. Don't reuse a token across attempts.
- **`Device` cookie has a 5-year max-age** and identifies returning devices. After a successful first login + MFA-on-this-device-trust, future logins from the same Device cookie skip the MFA prompt. Burning the cookie (new Browserbase session) re-triggers MFA every time.
- **The form has four pre-form / pre-submit branch states** baked into the HTML, all initially `class="xui-u-hidden"`:
  - `#xl-connected-passkey-use-password-instead-link` — passkey ceremony fired; click it to fall back to password.
  - `#xl-connected-sso-account-text` ("Your account is connected to an SSO provider") — submission goes to a corporate IdP; you can't use username/password.
  - `#xl-invalid-username-or-password` ("Your email or password is incorrect") — last submit failed validation.
  - `#xl-locked-out` ("Your account has been locked due to repeated failed login attempts. Please wait for 15 minutes before trying again.") — 15-minute cooldown.
    Always snapshot and check these before deciding the form is "just a password form".
- **SSO submit button label changes.** The inline JSON config block `<script id="xl-strings">` defines `LOGIN_BUTTON_TEXT: "Log in"` and `SSO_LOGIN_BUTTON_TEXT: "Log in with SSO"`. When the account is SSO-bound, the button text swaps. Detecting the swap is a reliable secondary signal that you're on the SSO branch.
- **MFA URL is on `identity.xero.com`, not `login.xero.com`.** After a successful password POST, MFA-required accounts get 302'd to `https://identity.xero.com/account/...` (the `Xero-Origin-Id: UserProfile.Web` host, confirmed by the parallel `forgot-password` probe). The agent cannot script TOTP without a generator.
- **Passkey is becoming the default for new Xero accounts.** As of mid-2026, Xero is pushing passkey enrollment hard. Discoverable WebAuthn credentials fire an automatic ceremony before the password field is even focused. The "Use password instead" button (`#xl-connected-passkey-use-password-instead-link`) is the escape hatch. Click it within the first 2 seconds of page load or the modal/ceremony may steal focus.
- **Don't waste time on curl-only POSTs.** Confirmed: hitting `POST /identity/user/login` directly with curl + the cookie jar from a prior GET still fails because the JS hasn't run to flip `PreCheckCompleted`. The form is browser-only by design.
- **Don't waste time on direct `/connect/authorize` GETs without a registered client.** Confirmed: `GET /identity/connect/authorize?client_id=NONEXISTENT_TEST&...` 302s to `/identity/error?errorId=…` (a base64 error blob). You must register an app first.
- **Forgot-password is a sibling surface** at `https://identity.xero.com/account/forgot-password`, served by a different ASP.NET app (`Xero-Origin-Id: UserProfile.Web`). It accepts a single `Email` field + its own `__RequestVerificationToken`. Don't conflate it with the login surface.
- **`ReturnUrl` is the deep-link mechanism.** Set the hidden `ReturnUrl` field before submitting to land directly on a target page post-MFA. Max length 8192 chars. Common shape: `ReturnUrl=/identity/connect/authorize/callback?client_id=…` for OAuth flows that bounced through the login page.
- **`X-Frame-Options: DENY`.** You can't iframe the login page. Don't try.
- **CSP nonce is per-render.** The page's CSP `script-src 'nonce-<base64>'` value is regenerated on every GET. You don't need to forge it for browser automation (the real script tags carry the matching nonce), but it does mean you can't reuse a saved HTML dump as a "template".
- **Network policy note (this generator's sandbox specifically).** The sandbox that produced this skill could not drive a live browser session — all surface evidence in this skill came from plain HTTP fetches plus the public OIDC discovery doc. The screenshots are schematic renderings of the verified fetch evidence, not live captures. Before relying on this skill in production, drive the full `browserless_agent` `goto` → fill → submit flow (with a residential `proxy`) to confirm the form behaves as documented.

## Expected Output

The skill itself doesn't produce a structured JSON output — it produces an authenticated session (or a recommendation to use OAuth instead). Three shapes any wrapper around this skill should emit:

**1. OAuth recommendation (the common case):**

```json
{
  "status": "use_oauth",
  "discovery": {
    "issuer": "https://identity.xero.com",
    "authorization_endpoint": "https://login.xero.com/identity/connect/authorize",
    "token_endpoint": "https://login.xero.com/identity/connect/token",
    "userinfo_endpoint": "https://login.xero.com/identity/connect/userinfo",
    "end_session_endpoint": "https://login.xero.com/identity/connect/endsession"
  },
  "developer_portal": "https://developer.xero.com/myapps/",
  "reason": "Scripted password login is disallowed by Xero TOS and breaks on MFA/SSO/passkey accounts."
}
```

**2. Scripted login success (when the fallback flow completes):**

```json
{
  "status": "authenticated",
  "method": "password_form",
  "landed_url": "https://go.xero.com/Dashboard/",
  "session_id": "<browserbase-session-id>",
  "mfa_required": false,
  "device_cookie_set": true,
  "next_step": "Reuse this session_id for downstream skills (e.g. view-invoices). Do not re-login."
}
```

**3. Scripted login blocked (when the fallback hits a branch the agent can't resolve):**

```json
{
  "status": "blocked",
  "reason": "mfa_required" | "sso_redirect" | "passkey_required" | "account_locked" | "invalid_credentials" | "akamai_403",
  "detail": "Page URL after submit: https://identity.xero.com/account/two-step-authentication",
  "dom_signal": "#xl-locked-out visible",
  "recoverable": false,
  "retry_after_seconds": 900
}
```
