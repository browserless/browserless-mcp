# Dub Top Market Beaters (Core Creators)

## Purpose

Return the current **Top Market Beaters** leaderboard from Dub's Core Creators on `web.dubapp.com` — the curated list of Core portfolios that are outperforming the market. For each ranked portfolio: name, ticker, creator display name, today's % return, all-time % return, short strategy description, and canonical profile URL. Read-only; never copies, follows, or invests.

## When to Use

- Daily / hourly tracking of which Core creator portfolios are leading the market on Dub.
- Building dashboards or alerts on top-performing copy-trading portfolios.
- Comparing Core (free-to-copy, curated) vs. Premium (paid) leaderboards on Dub.
- Any agent task that says "top creators / top portfolios / market beaters on Dub" — that exact phrase is a literal h2 section heading on `/explore`.

## Workflow

The full leaderboard is **fully server-side rendered** in the HTML returned by a single anonymous HTTP GET to a stable, public URL. No JavaScript execution, no login, no proxy, no captcha, no `?type=` toggle parsing — just `GET → parse HTML`. Sub-second. **Lead with the HTTP path; the browser flow is an unnecessary 100× cost wrapper around the same SSR'd payload.**

1. **Fetch the page** (Core Creators):

   ```
   GET https://web.dubapp.com/explore/market-beaters
   ```

   For Premium creators use `GET https://web.dubapp.com/explore/premium/market-beaters` (returns the analogous 20-card grid with title `Top Market Beaters - Premium`). The query-string form `?type=premium` is **silently ignored on this URL** — the Core vs Premium toggle is path-based, not param-based.

   Headers: none required. No `Referer`, no `User-Agent`, no `Cookie`. The page returns 200 OK with the full grid SSR'd into the HTML.

2. **Confirm the page rendered**. Sanity-check by looking for the canonical h1 in the response body:

   ```html
   <h1 class="... font-serif text-display-lg">Top Market Beaters</h1>
   ```

   and the subtitle `<p>Portfolios outperforming the market</p>`. If the h1 is missing, you were probably redirected (e.g. AppsFlyer smart-banner injecting JS); refetch.

3. **Split the grid into card chunks**. Each portfolio card begins with the literal anchor open-tag:

   ```
   <a class="flex h-full w-full" href="/portfolios/{HANDLE}">
   ```

   Splitting the HTML on `<a class="flex h-full w-full" href="/portfolios/` yields one chunk per card. The page renders **exactly 20 cards** on a single page (no pagination, no infinite scroll, no "See more" — `/explore/market-beaters` is the canonical full list as of the trace). Order is by rank: index 0 = rank 1.

4. **Extract fields per card chunk** (regex against each chunk):

   | Field                                  | Source                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
   | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | `handle` (portfolio ticker, uppercase) | The leading capture `([A-Za-z0-9_]+)` immediately after the split delimiter                                                                                                                                                           |
   | `name` (portfolio display name)        | `<p class="truncate text-md font-semibold text-primary">([^<]+)</p>`                                                                                                                                                                  |
   | `ticker`                               | `<span class="font-mono ... text-action">\$<!-- -->([A-Z0-9_]+)</span>` — note the literal `<!-- -->` comment node Next.js injects between `$` and the value                                                                          |
   | `creator` (display name)               | `<span class="truncate text-secondary">([^<]+)</span>` — the first such span after the `·` separator. May be a first-name + last-initial (e.g. `John P.`), a single name (`Jeremy`, `Seb`), or an org/handle (`APMIA`, `Hugh Mungus`) |
   | `today_return_pct`                     | `>Today<.*?<span ... text-(gain\|loss\|primary)[^"]*>([+-]?\d+\.\d+%)</span>` (DOTALL)                                                                                                                                                |
   | `all_time_return_pct`                  | `>All-Time<.*?<span ... text-(gain\|loss\|primary)[^"]*>([+-]?\d+\.\d+%)</span>` (DOTALL)                                                                                                                                             |
   | `description`                          | `<p class="line-clamp-\d ... text-secondary ...">([^<]+)</p>` — HTML-decode `&quot;`, `&amp;`, `&#x27;`, `&#39;`, Unicode entities (`’` → `'`)                                                                                        |
   | `profile_url`                          | `https://web.dubapp.com/portfolios/{handle}`                                                                                                                                                                                          |

5. **Sort sanity-check**: the page is ranked by **all-time return**, with rank 1 being the highest. Rank-1's `all_time_return_pct` should be the largest positive value among the 20 cards. The marketing copy ("Portfolios outperforming the market") means all 20 entries are alpha-positive over the lifetime window — but `today_return_pct` can be deeply negative on a market-wide red day and that's expected (the page does not re-rank intraday).

6. **Stamp `as_of`** with the current UTC date — the page itself does not include a server-side "last updated" timestamp. Cache-Control on the response is `private, no-cache, no-store, max-age=0, must-revalidate`, so each fetch is freshly regenerated server-side.

### Browser fallback

Only justified if Dub introduces a future anti-bot wall on the HTTP path (none observed). If needed, drive it with `browserless_agent`:

```json
{ "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "https://web.dubapp.com/explore/market-beaters", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } }
{ "method": "html", "params": { "selector": "body" } }
```

The `html` read returns the same SSR'd HTML as the HTTP fetch — parse it with the same regexes from step 4. The browser does not unlock any additional fields, it just adds cost and turn count.

Do **not** click any portfolio card during fallback — the portfolio detail page is not needed for the leaderboard task, and a stray click on the rendered "Copy" or "Invest" button is a real-money action surface (`dub` is a SEC-registered broker-dealer; this is a real trading app, not a paper demo).

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **No anti-bot wall observed.** Verified by 2 successive fetches through a residential proxy and 1 fetch with no proxy — all 3 returned 200 OK with the identical 20-card payload in the same rank order. A residential proxy is **not required** for this endpoint. Default to omitting the `proxy` arg on `browserless_agent`.
- **The phrase "Top Market Beaters" is a literal h2 section heading on multiple pages.** Disambiguate by URL: `/explore` shows a 3-card _carousel preview_ of Top Market Beaters with a "See all" link pointing to `/explore/market-beaters`; the latter is the full 20-card grid. The carousel on `/explore` only contains 3 cards in SSR — don't scrape it directly, follow the "See all" link.
- **Core vs Premium routing is path-based, not param-based.** `/explore/market-beaters` is Core (free copy-trading creators). `/explore/premium/market-beaters` is Premium (paid creators — Pelosi, Buffett, Infinity, etc.). The query-string `?type=premium` is silently ignored on `/explore/market-beaters` (page title stays "Top Market Beaters", not "...- Premium"). The `?type=core|premium` toggle **only** works on `/leaderboard`, not on `/explore`.
- **Don't confuse `/leaderboard` with `/explore/market-beaters`.** They are different surfaces with different data:
  - `/leaderboard?type=core` has three tables (Highest Returns, Most Copiers, Most Copying Capital), 9 rows each, with three time-window tabs (All Time / Monthly / Today). Only the _active_ tab (All Time by default) is SSR'd — the Monthly and Today panels exist in the DOM but their `<div>` body is empty until a client-side fetch fires on tab click. There is no observed URL param that selects a different default tab — tested `?window=`, `?period=`, `?tab=`, `?time=` (all monthly/today empty).
  - `/explore/market-beaters` is the dedicated "Top Market Beaters" page — 20 cards, no tabs, no time-window switcher. Today's % and All-Time % are both shown on every card.
- **Next.js `<!-- -->` comment nodes inside spans break naïve regex.** The ticker is rendered as `<span ...>$<!-- -->JOHNDPHAN</span>`, not `<span ...>$JOHNDPHAN</span>`. Always include `<!--\s*-->` in your ticker regex or use a tolerant capture (`\$\s*(?:<!--[^>]*-->)?\s*([A-Z0-9_]+)`).
- **Creator handle may be missing on some leaderboard rows.** On `/leaderboard?type=core`, the row for portfolios without a public creator @username (e.g. `$NUKEFUTURE`) has no `@username` span at all — it shows only the portfolio name and ticker. On `/explore/market-beaters`, every card has a `creator` field (display name), but format varies: first-name + last-initial (`John P.`), single name (`Jeremy`, `Seb`, `APMIA`), or full alias (`Hugh Mungus`). Don't assume a `@handle` pattern.
- **Image srcSet payloads are huge (~30% of HTML weight)** — the cards include 12-width responsive `srcSet` URLs each ~3KB. Strip `<img ... srcSet="..."/>` before regex-extracting fields to make parsing 3× faster, or just regex against the original HTML — both work, the latter is fine for 20-card pages.
- **Cache-Control is `no-store`.** Every fetch hits the origin (X-Vercel-Cache: MISS). Don't rate-limit yourself based on cache-hit assumptions — but also don't hammer: sustained ≤ 1 req/s is polite for a leaderboard that updates intraday at most.
- **This skill was verified end-to-end via a plain HTTP GET, not a remote browser session** (the build sandbox had HTTP egress but no remote-browser socket). For agents _consuming_ this skill both paths work; the HTTP path is still strictly preferred for cost.
- **dub is a regulated SEC-registered broker-dealer.** Treat any clickable button on a portfolio detail page as a potential trade-execution surface. The leaderboard extraction itself touches no execution surface — but during browser fallback, scope to read-only methods (`html`, `screenshot`, `snapshot`) and never `click` a portfolio card.

For the Premium-creator variant, set `creator_type: "premium"` and `page_url: "https://web.dubapp.com/explore/premium/market-beaters"` (also 20 cards, same schema).

Failure shapes (rare — only if the HTTP fetch itself fails):

```json

```

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "reason": "card_grid_missing",
  "note": "h1 'Top Market Beaters' present but 0 cards parsed — possible markup migration; refetch and inspect the leading anchor pattern"
}
