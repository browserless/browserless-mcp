  - method: url-param
    rationale: >-
      Nav serves the marketplace as SSR HTML at
      https://www.nav.com/marketplace/{slug}/ — a single GET returns the page
      chrome plus the first 6 offer cards. No auth, no anti-bot, no proxy
      required. This is the cheapest path for a shortlist.
  - method: browser
    rationale: >-
      Required only when (a) you need offers 7..N — the 'Show more' button is
      client-side React with no URL or fetch path, or (b) you want to apply UI
      filters (Financing Type, Annual Revenue, etc.) which are pure React state
      and ignored on the URL.
  - method: api
    rationale: >-
      Nav exposes no public REST or GraphQL endpoint for the marketplace. Tested
      ?_data=routes/... (Remix loader pattern) and various ?filter=, ?type=,
      ?financingType= params — all return the full unfiltered HTML page. The
      HTML response is the only API; offers 7..N are reachable only by clicking
      Show more or by decoding the React Router stream payload embedded in the
      response (custom decoder required).

# Nav Small-Business Funding Marketplace

## Purpose

Enumerate the small-business funding options listed on Nav's public marketplace — business loans, business credit cards, and trade credit (net-30+ vendor accounts) — and return each offer's terms (lender, funding amount, cost/APR/factor rate, repayment, funding speed, pros/cons). Read-only; never clicks "Apply now". Returns offers visible to anyone in the world (no auth, no anti-bot). For Nav's _personalized_ MatchFactor ranking, an account is required (see Gotcha below); this skill covers the public/anonymous view only.

## When to Use

- "What small-business loans, credit cards, or net-30 vendor accounts are listed on Nav today?"
- A finance agent assembling a comparison shortlist before a user signs up for a marketplace account.
- Daily/weekly cron to detect when a new partner is added to Nav's portfolio (offers list is small and stable enough to diff).
- Anywhere you want the raw partner list — name, lender, dollar ranges, APR/factor rate, funding speed — without scraping each lender's own site.

## Workflow

Nav's `/marketplace/{slug}/` pages are server-rendered Remix routes. A single page load returns the full HTML including the React Router stream payload, and the first 6 offer cards are fully visible in the rendered DOM. No auth, no anti-bot, no proxy required — a plain `browserless_function` fetch (or a `browserless_agent` `goto`) is enough. Heavier browser driving (clicking, filters) is **only** needed if you want offers 7–N (the "Show more" button is client-side JS) or to apply UI filters (filters are React state, ignored on the URL). For the typical "give me a shortlist" use case, the single page load returns enough.

### 1. Pick the marketplace category

| slug                    | What it lists                                                             | Count (2026-05-18) |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `business-loans`        | Term loans, lines of credit, SBA, MCA, equipment financing, cash advances | 23 offers          |
| `business-credit-cards` | Purchase cards, rewards/cash-back, charge cards, fuel cards               | 20 offers          |
| `trade-credit`          | Net-30+ vendor accounts (also reports to business credit bureaus)         | 29 vendors         |

URL template: `https://www.nav.com/marketplace/{slug}/`

### 2. Fetch the page

Load the page with `browserless_agent` and read the rendered HTML (the old CLI hit a one-shot Fetch endpoint; here you drive a real page):

```json
{ "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "https://www.nav.com/marketplace/business-loans/", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } }
{ "method": "html", "params": { "selector": "body" } }
```

The response is `text/html; charset=utf-8`, `Cache-Control: private`, served via Varnish — a single 200 OK, ~500 KB HTML body. That body is above the ~200k-char text-return cap, so in practice fold the Step 3 parse into an `evaluate` and return only the projected offer JSON rather than shipping the whole document back; the Python parser in Step 3 is the reference parsing logic. Nothing about this surface requires a proxy — a plain `browserless_function` that does `page.goto('https://www.nav.com/')` then a same-origin `fetch` of the marketplace path works equally well.

### 3. Parse the rendered offer cards (top 6)

Each `Apply now` button anchors one offer card. Split the HTML on `Apply now` markers and read each chunk up to the matching `Show details`. Within a chunk the structure is consistent:

```
{Offer Name} by {Lender}
{free-text description, optional}
Pros
{pro bullet 1}
{pro bullet 2}
…
Cons
{con bullet 1}
…
Funding Amount     {range}
Cost               {APR or factor rate or fee}
Repayment Terms    {schedule}
Funding Speed      {turnaround}
```

Reference Python parser (stable across the three marketplace slugs):

```python
import json, re
html = open("bl.html").read()
# Collapse tags to pipe-delimited tokens
t = re.sub(r"<[^>]+>", "|", html)
t = re.sub(r"\|+", "|", t)
t = re.sub(r"\s+", " ", t)
chunks = t.split("|Apply now|")[1:]  # 0th chunk is the page chrome

offers = []
for ch in chunks:
    end = ch.find("Show details")
    parts = [p.strip() for p in ch[:end].split("|") if p.strip()]
    if not parts: continue
    head = parts[0]                                         # "Short-Term Loan by Credibly"
    m = re.match(r"^(.*?)\s+by\s+(.+)$", head)
    name, lender = (m.group(1), m.group(2)) if m else (head, None)
    def field(label):
        try: return parts[parts.index(label)+1]
        except ValueError: return None
    pros, cons = [], []
    if "Pros" in parts and "Cons" in parts:
        pi, ci = parts.index("Pros"), parts.index("Cons")
        fi = parts.index("Funding Amount") if "Funding Amount" in parts else len(parts)
        pros, cons = parts[pi+1:ci], parts[ci+1:fi]
    offers.append({
        "name": name, "lender": lender,
        "funding_amount": field("Funding Amount"),
        "cost": field("Cost"),
        "repayment_terms": field("Repayment Terms"),
        "funding_speed": field("Funding Speed"),
        "pros": pros, "cons": cons,
    })
```

Read the total count from `Showing 1 - <!-- -->6<!-- --> of <!-- -->23` (regex: `r"Showing\s+1\s*-\s*<!--\s*-->\s*(\d+)\s*<!--\s*-->\s*of\s*<!--\s*-->\s*(\d+)"`). The literal HTML comments in the count badge are React-hydration markers — don't strip them before matching, or write the regex against the rendered text (`Showing 1 - 6 of 23`) after stripping tags.

### 4. (Optional) Extract all N offers from the stream payload — without a browser

The rendered DOM only shows the first 6 cards, but **all N offers' data is in the initial HTML response**, embedded in an inline `<script>` that calls `window.__reactRouterContext.streamController.enqueue("…")`. The encoded chunk is ~150 KB and uses a deduplicated positional-reference format (keys like `{"_1":2,"_3":-5}` where `_N` is a slot id and the integer is a pointer to another slot's value). Decoding it fully requires a custom resolver, but the offer titles (`{Name} by {Lender}`) are stored as plain JSON strings and are easy to regex out:

```python
import re
m = re.search(r'__reactRouterContext\.streamController\.enqueue\("((?:[^"\\]|\\.)*)"\)', html)
decoded = m.group(1).encode().decode("unicode_escape")
titles = sorted(set(re.findall(
    r'"([A-Z][^"\n]{8,80}\bby\s+[A-Z][A-Za-z &\.-]{2,30})"', decoded)))
# titles: all 21 unique loan-offer titles; the 23 total includes 2 brand variants
```

Recovering the full per-offer fields (Cost, Speed, Pros, Cons) from the stream requires walking the dedup table — feasible but several hundred lines. **In practice**: emit the top-6 from the DOM, and if the user explicitly asks for the full list, fall back to the browser path (Step 5).

### 5. Browser fallback — for offers 7+, filters, or "Apply now" follow-through

Open the page with `browserless_agent`, click `button: Show more` until the rendered count matches `total_results`, then re-run the Step 3 parser against the post-hydration HTML. Keep the whole open → click → click → extract flow inside **one** `browserless_agent` call's `commands` array — batching saves round-trips and avoids dropping the session config mid-flow (there is no session-release step to manage). The session is not torn down on return; it persists keyed by the call's `proxy`/`profile`, so a follow-up call with the same config reconnects to the still-hydrated page:

```json
{ "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "https://www.nav.com/marketplace/business-loans/", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } },
{ "method": "click", "params": { "selector": "button[data-testid=\"show-more-button\"]" } },
{ "method": "click", "params": { "selector": "button[data-testid=\"show-more-button\"]" } },
{ "method": "click", "params": { "selector": "button[data-testid=\"show-more-button\"]" } },
{ "method": "html", "params": { "selector": "body" } }
```

Repeat the `click` command ~3x for business-loans (each click reveals 6 more) until the rendered `Showing 1 - N of N results` count equals `total`. Filters (Financing Type, Annual Revenue, Time in Business, Credit Range, Personal Guarantee, etc.) are pure client-side React state — add `click` commands for the relevant sidebar checkboxes before the final `html`/`evaluate`, then re-extract. No URL or fetch path mirrors them. (If the `show-more-button` testid ever changes, confirm the selector via a `{ "method": "snapshot" }` first.)

A residential proxy (`proxy: { proxy: "residential" }`) is not required for the read path, but adding it costs nothing and gives parity with the personalized flow in case Nav later turns on geo-fencing.

### 6. (Out of scope) Personalized MatchFactor

The "See my options" CTA on every marketplace page (and the `Sign up` header link) routes to `https://app.nav.com/registration/`. That form requires email + password + business name + EIN/SSN, after which Nav's MatchFactor service ranks the same partner pool against the supplied business profile (revenue band, time in business, credit range). **This is out of scope for this read-only skill** — credentials would be needed and Nav would consume an application slot. If you need ranked matches, sign up manually and use a separate authenticated skill.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **No anti-bot whatsoever**: `Cache-Control: private` + `Vary: Accept-Encoding` + Varnish + Strict-Transport-Security. `robots.txt` explicitly `Allow: /` except `/a/affiliates/` and `/partner`. The page loads first try with no proxy, no stealth.
- **Only 6 cards in the rendered DOM, 23 in the payload**: SSR renders the first 6 of N offers visibly; the remaining (N−6) are present in the `__reactRouterContext` stream payload but not yet hydrated into DOM nodes. Use the stream extractor in Step 4 for inventory questions; use the browser fallback for full offer detail.
- **URL filter params are ignored**: `?financingType=SBA`, `?filter=…`, `?type=…`, `?page=2` — all tested, all return the unfiltered 23. Filters are client-side React state only.
- **`?_data=routes/...` (Remix loader) is not exposed**: tested `?_data=routes/marketplace`, `?_data=routes%2Fmarketplace.business-loans` — both return the full HTML page, not loader JSON. Nav appears to be on Remix v2 / React Router Data Router but with the loader-as-data response disabled. **Don't waste time looking for a `_data` JSON endpoint** — it doesn't exist on this surface.
- **No public REST or GraphQL endpoint**: no `/api/*` paths, no `graphql` references, no `_next/data/` (Nav is Remix, not Next.js). The HTML response is the API.
- **"Showing 1 - 6 of 23" has literal HTML comments inside it**: the badge renders as `Showing 1 - <!-- -->6<!-- --> of <!-- -->23` in the raw HTML (React hydration markers). Match against the rendered text after stripping tags, or include `<!--\s*-->` in the regex.
- **`Funding Amount`/`Cost`/`Repayment Terms`/`Funding Speed` is the canonical field set** for business loans. Business credit cards use a different set: `Intro APR`, `Purchase APR`, `Annual Fee`, `Welcome Offer`. Trade credit uses: `credit limit`, `fees`, `minimum order`, `Net-30/60/etc.`. Per-category parsers needed.
- **Personal Guarantee filter is always checked-off by default** — Nav lists offers that _require_ a personal guarantee alongside those that don't; this is one of the more useful filters when an LLC wants to limit personal liability exposure. The text "Personal Guarantee" appears in both the sidebar and the offer card descriptions.
- **MatchFactor is account-only**: `https://app.nav.com/registration/` is on a different subdomain (`app.` instead of `www.`), uses a separate Remix app, and gates everything personalized. The marketplace pages on `www.nav.com` are the only anonymous read surface.
- **All offers carry an `Apply now` CTA that opens a partner-redirect URL** (e.g. `https://www.nav.com/marketplace/business-loans/<offer-slug>/apply` → 302 to lender). **Do not click these**; they may consume a partner-application slot and Nav receives a referral fee on completion. Read-only enumeration stops at the offer card.
- **Advertiser disclosure is embedded**: every marketplace page includes Nav's disclosure that partners pay for placement and CTR. The order of offers is therefore commercial, not editorial — useful context if the agent is asked "which is best?".
- **`Cache-Control: private` + Varnish** means responses are not edge-cached for anonymous viewers; expect 100–400 ms response times depending on region. The `X-Cache` header reports `MISS, MISS` on cold reads and `HIT, MISS` (or vice versa) after warming.

## Expected Output

One JSON envelope per requested category. Top-level fields are identical across categories; the `offers[]` shape varies by category.
