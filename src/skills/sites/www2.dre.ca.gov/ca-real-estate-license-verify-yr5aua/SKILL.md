# California DRE Real Estate License Verification

## Purpose

Given an 8-digit California Department of Real Estate (DRE) license ID, return the licensee's name, license type (`SALESPERSON` | `BROKER` | `CORPORATION`), status, expiration date, mailing address, license-issued date, and any disciplinary-action comments. Read-only — never modifies any DRE record.

The skill targets the **public license lookup** at `www2.dre.ca.gov/publicasp/pplinfo.asp` — the same surface DRE links to from its "Verify a License" consumer page. No authentication, cookies, or anti-bot stealth is required.

## When to Use

- A consumer or compliance flow verifying that a CA real-estate licensee is currently licensed before transacting.
- A brokerage onboarding agents and confirming each rep's license status + responsible-broker affiliation.
- A title/escrow workflow validating the listing agent's license number against name on a purchase contract.
- Background-check / due-diligence pipelines pulling disciplinary-action records.

## Workflow

The public lookup serves the full record over plain HTTP GET — the form on `pplinfo.asp` is cosmetic. A single request retrieves the same HTML the form-POST flow produces.

### Recommended: Single HTTP GET deep-link

```bash
curl -s "https://www2.dre.ca.gov/publicasp/pplinfo.asp?License_id=01400000"
```

Or through Browserless (real browser page context — no proxy arg, the site has no anti-bot), as one `browserless_agent` call:

```jsonc
// browserless_agent commands
[
  {
    "method": "goto",
    "params": {
      "url": "https://www2.dre.ca.gov/publicasp/pplinfo.asp?License_id=${ID}",
      "waitUntil": "load",
      "timeout": 45000,
    },
  },
  { "method": "html", "params": { "selector": "body" } },
]
```

The response is a ~5–10 KB HTML page (200 OK, `Content-Type: text/html`, `Server: Microsoft-IIS/10.0`, `X-Powered-By: ASP.NET`). The license-information table sits between the `License Type:` label and the `>>>> Public information request complete <<<<` sentinel.

1. **Build the URL.** `https://www2.dre.ca.gov/publicasp/pplinfo.asp?License_id={ID}` where `{ID}` is the license number. Param name is case-insensitive — `License_id`, `license_id`, `LICENSE_ID`, and the URL-encoded form `License%5Fid` all work. Zero-padding to 8 digits is conventional but not required (`1400000` and `01400000` both resolve; **more than 8 digits returns NOTFOUND**).

2. **Send a plain GET.** No headers required. Session cookies (`ASPSESSIONID*`) are issued but not validated for `License_id=` queries.

3. **Detect NOTFOUND.** If the response contains the substring `No matching public record was found for License ID:` → emit `{ "found": false, "license_id": "..." }`. The HTML returns the search form, not a 404 status; success/failure must be detected from the body.

4. **Extract fields.** All fields live in a `<table>` of `<tr valign="top"><td><strong>Label:</strong></td><td>Value</td></tr>` rows. Some labels are wrapped in `<A HREF>` (`License Status`, `Comment`, `{Type} License Issued`, `Former Responsible Broker`). Multi-line values use `<br/>` separators (e.g., address line 1 `<br/>` city/state/zip).

   Reliable regex per field (case-insensitive, dot-all):

   ```js
   const grab = (label) => {
     const re = new RegExp(
       `<strong>(?:<a[^>]*>)?${label}(?:</a>)?:</strong>[^]*?size=2>([^<]+)`,
       'i',
     );
     const m = html.match(re);
     return m ? m[1].trim() : null;
   };
   const licenseType = grab('License Type'); // "SALESPERSON" | "BROKER" | "CORPORATION"
   const name = grab('Name');
   const licenseId = grab('License ID');
   const expiration = grab('Expiration Date'); // "MM/DD/YY"
   const status = grab('License Status'); // see status enum below
   const issuedDate = grab('(?:Salesperson|Broker|Corporation) License Issued');
   const comment = grab('Comment'); // "NO DISCIPLINARY ACTION" or text
   const mailingAddr = grab('Mailing Address'); // "<line1><br/>CITY, ST ZIP"
   const formerNames = grab('Former Name\\(s\\)');
   ```

5. **Type-specific extras.** Parse the type-specific blocks:
   - **SALESPERSON** → `Responsible Broker` row (linked License_id + brokerage name + address) and optional `Former Responsible Broker` rows.
   - **BROKER (individual)** → `Affiliated Licensed Corporation(s)` — one or more `<A HREF="pplinfo.asp?License_id=NNNNNNNN">NNNNNNNN</A>` links followed by the corporation name and expiration. Inactive officer affiliations carry an `OFFICER LICENSE EXPIRED AS OF MM/DD/YY` suffix.
   - **CORPORATION** → `Licensed Officer(s)` row containing `DESIGNATED OFFICER` and a linked License_id for the broker-officer.
   - All types → `Main Office`, `DBA`, `Branches` (corp/broker), `NO OTHER PUBLIC COMMENTS` sentinel.

6. **Detect disciplinary action.** Two independent signals:
   - **`Comment:` row** ≠ literal string `NO DISCIPLINARY ACTION` → disciplined. The cell text is a free-form history (e.g., `06/15/81 - DENIED W/RTR LIC ON T/C PER H-1660 SAC`). Multiple comment rows may follow.
   - **`License Status:` value contains `*** RESTRICTED ***`** (e.g., `EXPIRED *** RESTRICTED ***`) → restricted/disciplined.
   - Treat the licensee as having a disciplinary record if **either** signal fires. Pass the raw comment text(s) through.

7. **Stamp the as-of date.** The page prints `License information taken from records of the Department of Real Estate on M/D/YYYY H:MM:SS AM/PM` — capture this for output provenance.

8. **Validate with Zod.** A reference schema for the canonical output is in **Expected Output**. Apply at the boundary so downstream consumers get a stable shape regardless of which license-type variant came in.

### Browser fallback — name search

When the caller only has a name (no license ID), drive the form in one `browserless_agent` call. There's nothing to release afterward, so keep the whole flow (nav → fill → submit → read) in the single `commands` array to save round-trips:

```jsonc
// browserless_agent commands (no proxy arg)
[
  {
    "method": "goto",
    "params": {
      "url": "https://www2.dre.ca.gov/publicasp/pplinfo.asp",
      "waitUntil": "load",
      "timeout": 45000,
    },
  },
  {
    "method": "type",
    "params": {
      "selector": "input[name=\"LICENSEE_NAME\"]",
      "text": "Last, First",
    },
  },
  {
    "method": "click",
    "params": { "selector": "input[type=submit][value=Find]" },
  },
  {
    "method": "waitForSelector",
    "params": { "selector": "table", "timeout": 10000 },
  },
  { "method": "html", "params": { "selector": "body" } },
]
```

(If the Find-button selector misses, run `{ "method": "snapshot" }` first to read the current refs — the form's textboxes are `LICENSEE_NAME`, `CITY_STATE`, `LICENSE_ID`.) The form is `<form method="post" name="entry_form" action="pplinfo.asp?start=1">` with three text inputs (`LICENSEE_NAME` 40 chars, `CITY_STATE` 30 chars, `LICENSE_ID` 8 chars) and a hidden `h_nextstep=SEARCH`. A name search returns a **results list** (multiple matches) — `goto` each row's `?License_id=` deep-link to reach the same single-license detail page the GET returns, then apply the parsing logic from steps 4–8.

Alternative direct-POST (no browser):

```bash
curl -s -X POST "https://www2.dre.ca.gov/publicasp/pplinfo.asp?start=1" \
  --data-urlencode "h_nextstep=SEARCH" \
  --data-urlencode "LICENSEE_NAME=Last, First" \
  --data-urlencode "CITY_STATE=" \
  --data-urlencode "LICENSE_ID="
```

(The form-POST returns the same HTML the browser does; the only reason to use a browser is when you need to click into a result row from the list.)

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **The form is cosmetic for ID lookups.** `pplinfo.asp?License_id={ID}` (GET) returns the same detail page that the form's POST flow produces — no session cookie, no CSRF, no Referer required. Don't drive the form unless you need name search.
- **Plain HTTP, no anti-bot.** The site is classic IIS/ASP. Bare `curl` works; **do NOT add a `proxy` arg or stealth** to the `browserless_agent` call — it just adds latency. Verified with a direct HTTP GET, 200 OK in ~200ms per request.
- **`License_id` param name is case-insensitive.** `License_id`, `license_id`, `LICENSE_ID`, and `License%5Fid` (URL-encoded underscore — seen in DRE's own internal links) all resolve. Prefer `License_id` for consistency with DRE's published URLs.
- **Leading zeros optional, but >8 digits = NOTFOUND.** `1400000` and `01400000` both resolve to the same record. `000001400000` (12 digits) returns NOTFOUND. Normalize input by stripping non-digits then accepting 1–8 digit values.
- **NOTFOUND is 200 OK, not 404.** Detect failure from the body string `No matching public record was found for License ID:`, not from HTTP status. The not-found response also re-renders the search form above the message.
- **`License Status` enum is rich.** Observed values: `LICENSED`, `LICENSED NBA` (broker with No Broker Affiliation — i.e., not currently sponsoring salespersons), `EXPIRED`, `EXPIRED *** RESTRICTED ***`, `WITHHELD DENIED`, plus less-common combos (`*** RESTRICTED ***` may appear with other prefixes). Treat anything containing `*** RESTRICTED ***` as a disciplinary signal; treat `LICENSED` (with or without `NBA`) as currently valid.
- **`Expiration Date` is not always a date.** For records under temporary licenses it can be a sentence like `Temporary License issued through 01/04/96`. Schema must accept a free-form string here, not just `MM/DD/YY`.
- **Disciplinary signal lives in two places.** The `Comment:` row carries the disciplinary history text (free-form, multi-line), and the `License Status` may also include `*** RESTRICTED ***`. Either-or — confirm with both. The literal sentinel for "no discipline" is exactly the string `NO DISCIPLINARY ACTION`; anything else in the Comment field is real discipline content.
- **Type-specific row sets differ.** SALESPERSON has `Responsible Broker` (linked License_id of the brokerage). BROKER has `Affiliated Licensed Corporation(s)` (zero or more linked License_ids; expired ones tagged `OFFICER LICENSE EXPIRED AS OF MM/DD/YY`). CORPORATION has `Licensed Officer(s)` with a `DESIGNATED OFFICER` linked License_id. Don't assume all rows exist on every record.
- **Multi-value cells use `<br/>`.** Mailing-address and former-DBA cells concatenate lines with `<br/>` and no comma — `109 BAYSIDE PL<br/>CORONA DEL MAR, CA 92625`. Split on `<br/>` and re-assemble for normalization.
- **License Issued row is type-prefixed and "Unofficial" for old records.** Field is labelled `Salesperson License Issued`, `Broker License Issued`, or `Corporation License Issued`. For pre-1980-ish issuances, value carries the suffix `(Unofficial -- taken from secondary records)`. Strip the suffix or surface it as a confidence flag.
- **Page footer "Public information request complete" sentinel.** The literal string `>>>> Public information request complete <<<<` always terminates a successful response. Useful as a parsing fence and as a signal that the page rendered fully.
- **As-of timestamp is in the page body.** `License information taken from records of the Department of Real Estate on M/D/YYYY H:MM:SS AM/PM` — capture for provenance. DRE notes it does not include pending licensing changes.
- **There is a separate site at `pplinfo2.dre.ca.gov`.** The current `pplinfo.asp` HTML has a commented-out `<meta http-equiv="refresh">` pointing at `https://pplinfo2.dre.ca.gov/`. It's not active today (2026-05-26) — the comment confirms it was disabled. If DRE re-enables the redirect, the new site's URL pattern may differ; check for a redirect before assuming this skill still works.
- **No formal rate limit observed**, but keep requests ≤ 2 req/s — this is a state government IIS box. The ASP session cookie issued on each request is not validated for `License_id=` lookups but holding requests to a polite rate is courteous.
- **Disciplinary-action documents are not on this page.** The DRE main site links to PDFs under `/Licensees/DisciplinaryActions.html`, but those are not cross-referenced from the per-license detail page. The `Comment:` field summarizes discipline; full case documents must be fetched separately if needed.
- **Address-lookup is a different surface.** The form links to `https://secure.dre.ca.gov/addresslookup` for searching by office address — distinct skill, not covered here.
