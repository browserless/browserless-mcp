# California DRE License Verification

## Purpose

Given a California Department of Real Estate (DRE) license ID (8 digits, zero-padded) — or a licensee/company name — return the public license record: license type, name, mailing address, license status, expiration date, original issue date(s), MLO (NMLS) endorsement if any, broker affiliation, branches/DBAs (for brokers), and the public disciplinary-comment block. Read-only — never submits complaints or modifies state. Assumed interpretation: the caller wants to **verify** a license (is it real, what's its status), not enumerate the entire CA licensee roster.

## When to Use

- Confirm a self-identified California real estate agent or broker is actually licensed before signing a listing agreement, offer, or referral fee.
- Cross-check a licensee's NMLS / MLO endorsement before sending mortgage-related business.
- Bulk-validate a list of California licensees against the canonical DRE roster.
- Look up a licensee by name when the consumer only knows "the Smith from Coldwell Banker in Van Nuys" — and disambiguate among the multi-match list.

## Workflow

The DRE public-license-info site (`www2.dre.ca.gov/PublicASP/pplinfo.asp`) is a stateless classic-ASP form. It has **no anti-bot**, no cookies/session state, no CSRF tokens, no rate-limit headers, no auth, and no JavaScript dependency — the HTML response contains all the data inline. **Lead with plain HTTP, fall back to scripted browsing only if your network egress is somehow blocked from `*.ca.gov`.**

### 1. License-ID lookup (fastest path — GET deep-link)

When you have an 8-digit license ID, hit the detail page directly:

```
GET https://www2.dre.ca.gov/PublicASP/pplinfo.asp?License_id={ID}
```

- `{ID}` is the 8-digit zero-padded license number (e.g. `01244122`, `00142888`, `02058710`). Strip any non-digit characters from caller input, then left-zero-pad to 8.
- No headers required. No `Referer`. No proxies. No User-Agent gating observed.
- Response is HTML; status is always `200` — the not-found case is signalled in the body, **not** by an HTTP error code (see Gotchas).

Verified on 2026-05-22 with a plain HTTP GET (no proxy, no stealth, no browser session): single round-trip, ~6.5KB response, full data inline.

### 2. Name / company lookup (POST search)

When you have a person or company name instead of an ID:

```
POST https://www2.dre.ca.gov/PublicASP/pplinfo.asp?start=1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

h_nextstep=SEARCH&LICENSEE_NAME={Last%2C+First}&CITY_STATE={optional+city}&LICENSE_ID=
```

- `LICENSEE_NAME` format is `Last, First` (comma + space, URL-encoded as `%2C+`). For company / DBA / corporation lookups, supply the whole company name in the same field (e.g. `Coldwell+Banker`). The DRE site does not have a separate "company" field.
- `CITY_STATE` is optional — when present, restricts results to licensees whose **mailing-address city** matches. Note: this is mailing address, **not** main-office or branch-office city (see Gotchas).
- `LICENSE_ID` must be present-but-empty when doing a name search; the field name is mandatory in the body.
- `h_nextstep=SEARCH` is required — it's the form's hidden state token.

If exactly one record matches, the response is the full detail page (same shape as step 1). If many match, the response is a multi-row table.

### 3. Parse the detail-page response

The detail page uses a fixed `<strong>{Label}:</strong>` + `<td>{VALUE}</td>` pattern (legacy ASP with `<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">` wrappers around every cell). Extract by regex `<strong>([^<]+):</strong>[\s\S]*?<td[^>]*>(?:<FONT[^>]*>)?([^<]+(?:<br/>[^<]+)*)` (or use cheerio for cleaner parsing). The full set of labels observed across all license types:

| Field                                | Always present?       | Notes                                                                                                                                                                          |

Termination marker: the body ends with `>>>> Public information request complete <<<<`. Treat its presence as your "the response is a complete detail page (not the search form, not a multi-result table)" sentinel.

### 4. Parse the multi-match list response

When step 2 returns a list, the response contains the literal string `{X} to {Y} of {N} matches` and a `<table … id="nonsortabletable">` with one `<tr>` per licensee. Columns (in document order):

1. `License ID` — wrapped in `<a href="pplinfo.asp?License_id={ID}">` — these are the deep-links you'd feed back into step 1 to get full detail.
2. `Name` — `Last, First [Middle/Suffix]`; may be a company name; may carry a trailing `<i>(Canceled DBA Name)</i>` flag.
3. `License Type` — same enum as the detail page.
4. `Mailing Address City` — bare city, may be `< NO ADDRESS INFORMATION >`.
5. `Mortgage Loan Originator` — cell contains `YES` if MLO-endorsed, empty `&nbsp;` otherwise.

For verification purposes you almost always want to follow up with step 1 on each candidate to get full detail (status, expiration, NMLS ID).

### 5. Detect the not-found cases

- License-ID GET that misses: body contains `No matching public record was found for License ID: {ID}` — note the literal ID is echoed back into the message, so you can confirm the server interpreted your input correctly.
- Name POST that misses: body contains `No matching public record was found for Licensee: {NAME-UPPERCASED}` — note the server uppercases the echoed name.

Both still return HTTP `200`. **Do not trust status codes — always grep the body for one of the three terminator phrases**: `Public information request complete`, `matches` (with the digit-prefix), or `No matching public record was found`.

### Browser fallback

If for some reason direct HTTP is unreachable (corporate egress firewall blocking `*.ca.gov`, IP-level block we haven't observed in testing, etc.), drive it with one `browserless_agent` call. There's nothing to release afterward, so keep the whole nav→fill→submit→read flow in the single `commands` array to save round-trips:

```jsonc
// browserless_agent commands (no proxy arg — the site has no anti-bot)
[
  {
    "method": "goto",
    "params": {
      "url": "https://www2.dre.ca.gov/PublicASP/pplinfo.asp",
      "waitUntil": "load",
      "timeout": 45000,
    },
  },
  // Fill ONE of LICENSEE_NAME or LICENSE_ID — leave the other blank:
  {
    "method": "type",
    "params": {
      "selector": "input[name=\"LICENSE_ID\"]",
      "text": "{8-digit-id}",
    },
  },
  // OR for name search:
  // { "method": "type", "params": { "selector": "input[name=\"LICENSEE_NAME\"]", "text": "Last, First" } },
  {
    "method": "click",
    "params": { "selector": "input[type=submit][value=Find]" },
  },
  {
    "method": "waitForSelector",
    "params": { "selector": "strong", "timeout": 10000 },
  },
  { "method": "html", "params": { "selector": "body" } },
]
```

**No stealth or residential proxy is needed** — confirmed with a plain HTTP GET returning 200 with full data, so leave the `proxy` arg off (adding it is pure cost overhead). Since the browser path executes in a real page anyway, the GET deep-link (`goto ?License_id=...` + `evaluate`) is still the simplest — reserve the form-fill flow for name search. If even the browser path is blocked, retry once with `proxy: { proxy: "residential" }` to rule out an IP-block.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **License ID must be 8 digits, zero-padded**. `1244122` won't match; `01244122` will. Strip non-digits then `String(id).padStart(8, '0')`.
- **No HTTP error codes for "not found"**. The server returns `200 OK` regardless of outcome. The body's terminator phrase is the only reliable success/failure signal — see step 5. Naïve `response.ok` checks will misclassify every not-found case as success.
- **Name search is `Last, First` — comma is mandatory.** `Smith John` returns a different (often empty) result set than `Smith, John`. The form's own help link at `/static/NameHelp.htm` documents this. Companies and corporations are searched in the same field with no comma.
- **Echoed name is uppercased**. The not-found-by-name message uppercases the input (e.g. `ZXQWERTY, BOBNONEXISTENT`). Use case-insensitive matching if echoing back to a user.
- **`CITY_STATE` filter matches mailing-address city, not office city.** The form's own footer warns: "The 'Mailing Address City' may differ from the licensee's main office and/or branch office city." A broker headquartered in San Francisco may list a Palo Alto mailing address and be missed by `CITY_STATE=San+Francisco`. For office-city lookups, use the separate Address Lookup tool at `https://secure.dre.ca.gov/addresslookup`.
- **Single-result auto-redirect**. A name search that matches exactly one record returns the detail page (not a one-row table). Don't assume the search endpoint always returns a list — detect by presence of `Public information request complete`.
- **`pplinfo2.dre.ca.gov` is NOT live**. The HTML contains a commented-out `<meta refresh>` to `https://pplinfo2.dre.ca.gov/`, suggesting a planned modernization. As of 2026-05-22 the host returns `ERR_TUNNEL_CONNECTION_FAILED` — DNS resolves but no listener responds. Confirmed dead. Don't waste time probing it; `www2.dre.ca.gov/PublicASP/pplinfo.asp` is the only working surface.
- **Expiration date is 2-digit year (`MM/DD/YY`)**. License `01000000`'s `12/02/96` is 1996, but `01244122`'s `10/27/28` is 2028. Apply the standard pivot (`YY ≤ 50 → 20YY`, else `19YY`) when computing absolute dates — and double-check status, since EXPIRED + `XX/XX/96` is unambiguous but LICENSED + `XX/XX/28` is the active-2028 case.
- **`Comment: NO DISCIPLINARY ACTION` is the clean-record baseline.** Any other Comment-cell content is the disciplinary signal — disbarments, restrictions, decisions. Don't suppress this field or future agents using this skill will miss the headline reason consumers query DRE in the first place. Linked statute documents (when present) are public PDFs.
- **MLO endorsement is a separate identity (NMLS).** The DRE license verifies CA-state real-estate licensure; the embedded NMLS ID verifies mortgage-loan-originator endorsement and must be cross-checked at `nmlsconsumeraccess.org/entitydetails.aspx/individual/{nmlsId}` for federally-regulated mortgage activity. The DRE detail page itself doesn't expose NMLS status — only the ID.
- **`(Canceled DBA Name)` flag in name-search results**. Multi-match rows for company-name searches may carry a trailing `<i>(Canceled DBA Name)</i>` marker on the Name column. These are historical entries and the underlying license is no longer doing business under that name. Surface the flag to the caller if echoing search results.
- **The hidden `h_nextstep=SEARCH` form field is required**. Posting without it returns the empty form, not a search response. Treat it as a static incantation.
- **Form encoding sensitivity**: `LICENSEE_NAME` containing literal commas must be encoded as `%2C` or `,`; spaces as `+` or `%20`. The server is lenient about either choice but consistent within a single request.
