# California DRE Real Estate License Verification

## Purpose

Verify a California real estate license number against the California Department of Real Estate (DRE) public license lookup and return the licensee's structured record: name, license type (BROKER / SALESPERSON / CORPORATION), status, expiration date, issue date(s), main office address, mailing address, MLO/NMLS endorsement, affiliated entities, and any public disciplinary actions or comments (with links to hearing PDFs when present). Strictly read-only — the public lookup is unauthenticated.

## When to Use

- A consumer or compliance system wants to confirm that an agent / broker / corporation holds an active CA real estate license.
- A vendor onboarding flow needs to verify license #, expiration, and clean discipline status before allowing transactions.
- A title / escrow / lender workflow needs the MLO (NMLS) endorsement number associated with a CA broker.
- A due-diligence agent wants the full public record (former names, DBAs, affiliated corporations, disciplinary history with hearing PDFs).

## Workflow

**Optimal path: a single HTTP GET. No form submission needed.** The public form (`pplinfo.asp`) accepts the License ID directly as a query parameter, and the server returns the rendered license record on the same URL. Skip the POST form entirely.

1. **Construct the request URL.** California DRE license numbers are exactly 8 digits, zero-padded (e.g. `01258261`). Build:

   ```
   https://www2.dre.ca.gov/publicasp/pplinfo.asp?License_id=01258261
   ```

   The parameter name is **case-sensitive**: `License_id` (only the `L` is capitalized). `LICENSE_ID` works in the POST form but `License_id` is the canonical GET form used by the site's own outbound links.

2. **Fetch over plain HTTPS.** No headers, cookies, user-agent stealth, or session required. The endpoint is IIS / classic ASP, returns `Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8`, and sets a session cookie you can ignore. Status is always `200` even for not-found (see Site-Specific Gotchas).

3. **Detect the response shape first** — the same URL serves two layouts:
   - **Found** → response body contains `<strong>License Type:</strong>`. Continue to step 4.
   - **Not found** → response body contains `No matching public record was found for License ID:`. Return `{ found: false, license_id, error: "..." }` and stop.

4. **Parse the result table.** The licensee data is a single `<table>` with `<tr>` rows where the first `<td>` is a bolded label (e.g. `<strong>License Type:</strong>`) and the second `<td>` is the value. Strip the heavy `<FONT FACE="...">` wrappers — they're cosmetic noise from a 2010-era template. Map labels to fields:

   | Label in HTML                                            | Field                                                                                                                                                                           |

   | `Affiliated Licensed Corporation(s):`                    | `affiliated_corporations[]` — broker only — `{license_id, name, officer_expiration_date, status?}`                                                                              |
   | `Licensed Officer(s):`                                   | `licensed_officers[]` — corporation only — `{role?, license_id, name, expiration_date, status?}`                                                                                |
   | `Broker Associates:` / `Salespersons:`                   | `broker_associates[]` / `salespersons[]` — corporation only — `{license_id, name, expiration_date}`                                                                             |
   | `Broker Associate for:` / `Former Broker Associate for:` | `broker_associate_for[]` / `former_broker_associate_for[]` — list of brokerages the person is currently / formerly affiliated with                                              |
   | `Comment:`                                               | `comments[]` — each row is a separate event; first row is either `NO DISCIPLINARY ACTION` or a dated discipline event. Look for `NO OTHER PUBLIC COMMENTS` as the terminator    |
   | `Disciplinary or Formal Action Documents:`               | `disciplinary_documents[]` — array of `{filename, url}` pointing to `/hearingfiles/*.pdf`. **Only appears when discipline exists.**                                             |

5. **Return a Zod-validated object.** See `Expected Output` for the canonical shape. `disciplinary_documents` and `comments` fields where they exist are the primary signal of disciplinary history — the existence of any non-empty PDF entry, or any `comments[]` entry that doesn't equal `"NO DISCIPLINARY ACTION"` / `"NO OTHER PUBLIC COMMENTS"`, indicates discipline.

### Browser fallback

Use only if the plain-HTTP GET path is blocked (restricted egress) or you must drive the POST form. Run one `browserless_agent` call with a `commands` array — there's no session to release, and keeping the whole nav→fill→submit→read flow in the single call saves round-trips:

1. `{ "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "https://www2.dre.ca.gov/publicasp/pplinfo.asp", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } }`
2. `{ "method": "type", "params": { "selector": "input[name=\"LICENSE_ID\"]", "text": "<8-digit-id>" } }` — uppercase `LICENSE_ID` here (the POST form uses a different case than the GET param).
3. `{ "method": "click", "params": { "selector": "input[type=submit][value=Find]" } }` — the form POSTs to `pplinfo.asp?start=1` with hidden field `h_nextstep=SEARCH` (a full server-rendered page replace). Confirm the button selector via `snapshot` if it misses.
4. `{ "method": "waitForSelector", "params": { "selector": "strong", "timeout": 10000 } }` then `{ "method": "html", "params": { "selector": "body" } }` (or fold the parse into an `evaluate`) and parse the same table layout described above.

Since egress here goes through a real browser page, the GET deep-link is still simplest: a single `{ "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "https://www2.dre.ca.gov/publicasp/pplinfo.asp?License_id=<id>" } }` + `evaluate` avoids the form entirely.

The form has three text inputs (`LICENSEE_NAME`, `CITY_STATE`, `LICENSE_ID`) — only `LICENSE_ID` is needed for license-number lookup. `LICENSEE_NAME` searches by name and returns a results list, which is a different workflow (not covered here).

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **The endpoint always returns HTTP 200**, even for not-found. Discriminate on body content (`No matching public record was found for License ID:`), not status code.
- **`License_id` (query param) vs `LICENSE_ID` (form field)** — the GET URL uses mixed-case `License_id`; the POST form uses uppercase `LICENSE_ID`. Both work but the canonical GET style is what the site's own internal links use (e.g. `<A HREF="/publicasp/pplinfo.asp?License_id=01769292">`).
- **License IDs are 8-digit zero-padded strings**, not integers. `01258261` ≠ `1258261`. The form input has `maxlength="8"`. Preserve leading zeros.
- **Expiration / issue dates use 2-digit years** (`05/19/28`). Disambiguate yourself — anything `<25` is generally 21st century and `>=80` 20th century, but mixing in the page is unavoidable. Don't try to "fix" them — store the raw string.
- **The HTML is from a 2010-era classic ASP template.** Every cell is wrapped in nested `<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" size=2>…</FONT>` tags with frequently missing close tags. Use a tolerant HTML parser (cheerio, parse5, BeautifulSoup, etc.) — regex extraction is fragile. Strip nested font/br noise during normalization.
- **The "new" lookup site `pplinfo2.dre.ca.gov`** appears in search results (e.g. `https://pplinfo2.dre.ca.gov/PPLInfo/PplInfoStart?LicenseID=…`) and an HTML comment in the legacy page references a redirect to it (`<!-- Redirect to new PPL INFO  <meta http-equiv="refresh"...> -->`) — but the redirect is **commented out** and the new endpoint **returns 500 Internal Server Error** as of 2026-05. **Stick with `www2.dre.ca.gov/publicasp/pplinfo.asp`.** If the new site comes back online, the URL param name there is `LicenseID` (different casing again).
- **Disciplinary action documents** only render when discipline exists. Absence of the `Disciplinary or Formal Action Documents:` row is not an error — it means clean record. Cross-check with the `Comment:` section: `NO DISCIPLINARY ACTION` confirms clean.
- **The `Comment:` section is unstructured prose**, dated by line. Example: `04/23/21 - H-41938 LA` (case filed), `03/08/22 - REVOKED-RIGHT TO RESTRICTED LICENSE PER H-41938 LA`, `09/17/24 - PETITION FOR REINSTATMENT OF BROKER LICENSE GRANTED PER H-41938 LA`. Treat each row as a free-text event keyed by the leading `MM/DD/YY` token, plus a final literal row `NO OTHER PUBLIC COMMENTS`.
- **License Status string values are not normalized to title case** — the page returns `LICENSED ` (with trailing space) or `LICENSE EXPIRED` etc. Trim before comparing. Reference `https://www2.dre.ca.gov/static/licstatus.htm` for the canonical enum if you need to map to a known set.
- **The CORPORATION shape is structurally different from BROKER/SALESPERSON.** Corporations have `Licensed Officer(s):` (designated + non-designated), `Broker Associates:`, and `Salespersons:` rows that brokers/salespeople do not. The Zod schema in `output_schema.ts` treats all three as a discriminated union on `license_type`.
- **No anti-bot, no captcha, no rate-limit observed during testing.** Direct fetch is safe. No stealth or residential proxy is needed — a plain `browserless_agent` `goto` with no `proxy` arg is sufficient; adding one is pure cost overhead.
- **Server cookies (`ASPSESSIONIDxxx`) are sent on every response.** You can ignore them entirely for single-license lookups; they're only relevant for the multi-step search-by-name flow.
- **A salesperson license that has been disciplined or has many affiliations can return a very large HTML body** (one test license returned ~400 KB). Make sure your fetch buffer / streaming can handle it.

## Expected Output

The canonical shape is a discriminated union on `license_type`. Validated by the `OutputSchema` exported from `output_schema.ts`.

- "Disciplinary actions" includes both unstructured `Comment:` rows AND linked PDFs under `Disciplinary or Formal Action Documents:` — both are surfaced. `has_discipline` is true iff either a non-trivial comment OR any PDF exists.
- "Status" returned to caller is the raw `License Status:` cell value, trimmed. Caller can map to a normalized enum if needed.
- Salesperson lookups follow the same BROKER schema minus the broker/officer-specific fields — represented as `license_type: "SALESPERSON"` in the discriminated union.
