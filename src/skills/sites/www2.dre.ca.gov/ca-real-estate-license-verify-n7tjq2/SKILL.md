    rationale: >-
      Only useful when HTTP is unavailable. The page renders without JavaScript,
      has no anti-bot, no rate limit, no cookies — so even the browser path
      should construct the deep-link URL (`?License_id=XXXXXXXX`) and `goto` it
      directly rather than clicking the form's Find button (a native form submit
      here is flaky mid-navigation).
  - method: api
    rationale: >-
      DRE publishes no official JSON API. The classic-ASP endpoint is HTML-only
      — `recommended_method: fetch` reflects that the optimal path is a plain
      HTTP GET, not a JSON API call.

# California DRE Real Estate License Verification

## Purpose

Given an 8-digit California Department of Real Estate (DRE) license number,
fetch the public licensee record from
`https://www2.dre.ca.gov/publicasp/pplinfo.asp` and return a Zod-validated
JSON object containing the licensee name, license type, status, expiration
date, mailing address, responsible broker (where applicable), and any
disciplinary action history (comments + linked PDF document filenames).
Read-only; never mutates state.

## When to Use

- "Is California real estate license `01974439` still valid?"
- Pre-funding / pre-listing due-diligence on an agent or broker.
- Bulk verification of a list of licensees (one HTTP call per ID, ~1 s each).
- Confirming a broker's disciplinary history before signing a representation
  agreement.
- Cross-referencing a Salesperson against their `Responsible Broker` or
  cross-referencing a Corporation against its `Licensed Officer(s)` and
  affiliated Salespersons.

## Workflow

DRE's public-lookup endpoint is a vanilla classic-ASP page (Microsoft IIS
10.0) served over plain HTTPS. **No anti-bot, no rate-limiting cookies, no
JavaScript required to render the detail page, no proxies needed.** Crucially,
the detail page has a stable **deep-link URL** — you do not need to fill the
form. Lead with `fetch`; the browser flow exists only as a fallback for the
small subset of agents that cannot make HTTP calls.

### 1. Deep-link fetch (recommended)

```bash
curl -s "https://www2.dre.ca.gov/publicasp/pplinfo.asp?License_id=01974439"
```

Returns a small (~4–8 KB) HTML detail page when the ID exists, or the
~18 KB empty-form page when it does not.

Equivalent forms (all 200-OK, all return the same body):

| Variant                | URL / body                                                   | Notes                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Direct GET (preferred) | `GET ?License_id=01974439`                                   | One round-trip.                                                                                            |
| Form POST              | `POST ?start=1` with `h_nextstep=SEARCH&LICENSE_ID=01974439` | Same response; useful only when you also want to drive name/city search.                                   |
| Unpadded GET           | `GET ?License_id=1974439`                                    | ASP coerces `1974439`→`01974439`. Don't rely on this — always send the canonical 8-digit zero-padded form. |

Through Browserless (real browser page context), the same GET is one
`browserless_agent` call:

```jsonc
// browserless_agent commands
[
  {
    "method": "goto",
    "params": {
      "url": "https://www2.dre.ca.gov/publicasp/pplinfo.asp?License_id=01974439",
      "waitUntil": "load",
      "timeout": 45000,
    },
  },
  { "method": "html", "params": { "selector": "body" } },
]
```

(For the POST variant, drive the form in the same call — or issue an in-page
`fetch()` via `evaluate` after the `goto` lands you on-origin — see Browser
Fallback.)

### 2. Detect success vs. not-found

| Marker                                     | Meaning                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Response contains literal `License Type:`  | Detail page — proceed to parse.                                                                              |
| No `License Type:` and size ≈ 18,000 bytes | License ID is invalid / not found. The server silently re-renders the empty form (no error message, no 4xx). |

Do **not** rely on HTTP status — both shapes are 200 OK.

### 3. Parse the detail table

Every field is a `<tr>` of two `<td>` cells: a labeled `<strong>` on the
left and the value (in a nested `<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" size=2>`)
on the right. Markup hasn't changed since the page's 2010 footer line.
Stable single-pass regex per field (HTML, not text):

```text
licensee_name      /<strong>Name:<\/strong>[\s\S]*?size=2>([^<]+)/
license_type       /<strong>License Type:<\/strong>[\s\S]*?size=2>([^<]+)/
license_id         /<strong>License ID:<\/strong>[\s\S]*?size=2>([^<]+)/
mailing_address    /<strong>Mailing Address:<\/strong>[\s\S]*?size=2>([\s\S]*?)<\/font>/   (multi-line; join <br/> with ", ")
expiration_date    /<strong>Expiration Date:<\/strong>[\s\S]*?size=2>([^<]+)/   (MM/DD/YY)
license_status     /<strong>(?:<A[^>]*>)?License Status(?:<\/A>)?:<\/strong>[\s\S]*?size=2>([^<]+)/
issued_date        /<strong>(?:<A[^>]*>)?(?:Salesperson|Broker|Corporation|Officer) License Issued(?:<\/A>)?:<\/strong>[\s\S]*?size=2>([^<]+)/
```

For the Comment / Disciplinary section, capture every `<tr>` whose left
`<td>` `<strong>` is empty (sub-rows) starting from the `Comment:` row
until the trailing sentinel `>>>> Public information request complete <<<<`.
Then walk forward to capture `Disciplinary or Formal Action Documents:`
links — each `H#####FR_YYMMDD_*.pdf` filename is a separate document.

### 4. Validate with Zod

```ts
const License = z.object({
  success: z.literal(true),
  license_id: z.string().regex(/^\d{8}$/),
  licensee_name: z.string(),
  license_type: z.enum(['SALESPERSON', 'BROKER', 'OFFICER', 'CORPORATION']),
  license_status: z
    .enum([
      'LICENSED',
      'EXPIRED',
      'REVOKED',
      'SUSPENDED',
      'SURRENDERED',
      'CANCELED',
      'DELINQUENT',
    ])
    .optional(), // omitted on OFFICER rows
  expiration_date: z
    .string()
    .regex(/^\d{2}\/\d{2}\/\d{2}$/)
    .optional(),
  issued_date: z
    .string()
    .regex(/^\d{2}\/\d{2}\/\d{2}$/)
    .optional(),
  mailing_address: z.string(),
  address_unreliable: z.boolean().default(false), // see Gotchas
  former_names: z.array(z.string()).default([]),
  responsible_broker: z
    .object({
      license_id: z.string(),
      name: z.string(),
      address: z.string(),
    })
    .nullable()
    .optional(), // SALESPERSON-only
  affiliated_corporations: z
    .array(
      z.object({
        license_id: z.string(),
        name: z.string(),
        status: z.string(),
      }),
    )
    .default([]), // BROKER / OFFICER
  licensed_officers: z
    .array(
      z.object({
        license_id: z.string(),
        name: z.string(),
        expiration_date: z.string(),
        role: z.string().optional(),
      }),
    )
    .default([]), // CORPORATION
  affiliated_salespersons_count: z.number().optional(), // CORPORATION
  dbas: z.array(z.object({ name: z.string(), period: z.string() })).default([]),
  branches: z.array(z.string()).default([]),
  disciplinary_actions: z.array(z.string()).default([]),
  disciplinary_documents: z.array(z.string()).default([]),
});
const NotFound = z.object({
  success: z.literal(false),
  license_id: z.string(),
  error_reasoning: z.literal('License ID not found in DRE database'),
});
export const Result = z.union([License, NotFound]);
```

### Browser Fallback

Only if HTTP isn't an option (restricted egress blocks outbound fetch, etc.). One `browserless_agent` call — no session-release step is needed (nothing to release):

```jsonc
// browserless_agent commands (no proxy arg — no anti-bot)
[
  {
    "method": "goto",
    "params": {
      "url": "https://www2.dre.ca.gov/publicasp/pplinfo.asp?License_id=01974439",
      "waitUntil": "load",
      "timeout": 45000,
    },
  },
  { "method": "html", "params": { "selector": "body" } }, // then apply the regex above
]
```

**Prefer the deep-link `goto ?License_id=...` over clicking the form's `Find` submit button** — see Site-Specific Gotchas: a native form submit here is flaky mid-navigation. If you must POST, do it via an in-page `fetch()` in an `evaluate` (which does not navigate).

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **The form's native `submit()` is flaky mid-navigation.** Clicking the Find button (or calling `document.entry_form.submit()` inside an `evaluate`) on this page can drop the page connection mid-navigation, wedging the session. The deep-link `goto ?License_id=...` avoids this entirely. If you must POST, do it via an in-page `fetch()` in an `evaluate` (which does not navigate) rather than the form's native submit.
- **Not-found returns 200 OK + the empty form page (~18 KB), not 4xx.** Detect by absence of `License Type:` in the body. Status code alone is not a signal.
- **OFFICER rows omit `License Status` and `Expiration Date` at the top level.** Their status is encoded in the `Affiliated Licensed Corporation(s)` sub-row (e.g. `OFFICER LICENSE EXPIRED AS OF 11/03/09`). Don't error if those top-level fields are missing on a `License Type: OFFICER` record.
- **Disciplinary action lives in two places, not one.** Clean records show `NO DISCIPLINARY ACTION` followed by `NO OTHER PUBLIC COMMENTS` under the `Comment:` row. Records with active discipline replace the first line with date-stamped entries (e.g. `12/03/25 - REVOKED PER H-03611-FR`) and add a `Disciplinary or Formal Action Documents:` block of PDF filenames (`H03611FR_251203_P.pdf`). The PDFs are served from `https://www2.dre.ca.gov/publicasp/disciplinary/<filename>.pdf` — but the lookup page only exposes the bare filenames, so you must construct the URL yourself. Confirmed `2026-05-26`: filenames in our trace resolve at that path.
- **Pursuant to Business & Professions Code §10083.2(c), some disciplinary information may have been removed from the public record.** The header disclaimer states discipline info may still be available on written request. The skill cannot surface what isn't in the response — when reporting "no disciplinary action," note that this reflects only the public record.
- **`(Above address is marked unreliable in DRE database)` is a parenthetical note** that appears under the mailing address for some licensees (e.g. license `01974439`). It is sibling text, not part of the address — strip it and surface as a separate boolean (`address_unreliable: true`).
- **Date format is two-digit year (`MM/DD/YY`).** Pre-2000 issue dates exist (license `00600964` issued long before 2000), so naïve `20YY` expansion can be wrong — but DRE displays only the 2-digit form. Keep the raw `MM/DD/YY` string and let the caller decide on century resolution; do not auto-expand.
- **License IDs are zero-padded 8-digit strings.** The endpoint silently coerces shorter numerics (`?License_id=1974439` works for `01974439`), but always send the canonical zero-padded form — some downstream parsers compare strings, not integers.
- **Corporation records can be very large (~75 KB+)** when the entity has many DBAs, branches, and officers. Plan for streaming or chunked parsing. The Salespersons list is _not_ inlined — it shows only a count and a `RETRIEVE SALESPERSON LIST` button that POSTs to a separate endpoint. If you need the full salesperson roster for a corp, that is a follow-up call (out of scope for this skill).
- **Search-by-name (`POST h_nextstep=SEARCH&LICENSEE_NAME=Smith&CITY_STATE=&LICENSE_ID=`) returns a large flat list (~2 MB for common surnames like Smith).** Each item is `<a href="pplinfo.asp?License_id=XXXXXXXX">XXXXXXXX</a></td> <td> {Name} </td><td>{Type}</td><td>{City}</td>` — useful as a discovery step when the caller has only the licensee's name. There is no pagination; the response is one giant `<table>`.
- **There is a "new" lookup at `https://pplinfo2.dre.ca.gov/`** (referenced in a commented-out `<meta refresh>` in the page head). At time of writing (2026-05-26) the redirect is disabled and `pplinfo2.dre.ca.gov` is **not** a stable alternative — stick with `www2.dre.ca.gov/publicasp/pplinfo.asp`.
- **The `<head>` of the response varies by code path.** The detail-page success response has a minimal `<head>` (no CSS stylesheet imports, no navigation chrome); the form / not-found response has the full ~14 KB site chrome. This is the cheapest size-based heuristic: detail < 10 KB, not-found ≈ 18 KB.
- **No `Cache-Control` on detail pages** (`Cache-Control: private`). Each request hits the IIS app server. Empirical throughput from us-west-2 to DRE is ~1 req/s sustained without any signs of throttling, but be polite — this is a single-server government site.
