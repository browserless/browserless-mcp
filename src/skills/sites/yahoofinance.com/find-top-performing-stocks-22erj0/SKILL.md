# Find Top Performing Stocks (Yahoo Finance)

## Purpose

Return the N highest-performing individual stocks on Yahoo Finance — the "Top Gainers" list ranked by intraday percent change. For each stock it returns symbol, company name, last price, absolute change, percent change, volume, market cap, and exchange. Read-only; never trades, logs in, or mutates anything.

**Assumption made (no human to clarify):** "highest performing single stocks" is interpreted as Yahoo Finance's headline **Day Gainers** list — the equities with the largest positive percent change in the current/most-recent US session — which is exactly what the site surfaces at `/markets/stocks/gainers/`. This list applies Yahoo's built-in liquidity/size floors (see Gotchas), so it is the "top performers among real, tradeable large/mid-cap names," not the absolute highest-percent movers including micro-caps. If you want the unfiltered highest movers, see the alternate `scrIds` in Gotchas.

## When to Use

- "Give me the top 5 (or N) performing / gaining stocks today."
- Daily market-open or market-close monitoring of the biggest movers.
- Seeding a watchlist or downstream analysis with the day's leaders.
- Any flow that would otherwise scrape the Yahoo Finance "Top Gainers" table — the JSON API is faster, cheaper, and structurally stable.

## Workflow

Yahoo Finance's "Top Gainers" page is a thin client over a **public predefined-screener JSON API** that needs **no crumb, no auth, no cookies, and no residential proxy**. A plain GET returns ranked results. Lead with the API; the browser path is a ~100× more expensive fallback that returns the identical data.

### 1. Call the predefined screener (recommended)

```
GET https://query1.finance.yahoo.com/v1/finance/screener/predefined/saved
    ?scrIds=day_gainers
    &count=5
    &formatted=false
```

- `scrIds=day_gainers` is the "Top Gainers" list (ranked by `regularMarketChangePercent` descending).
- `count=N` caps how many rows you get back (use the N the user asked for).
- `formatted=false` returns raw numeric values (`32.7582`). Omit it (or `formatted=true`) to get `{raw, fmt}` objects (`{"raw":32.7582,"fmt":"+32.76%"}`) if you want display strings.
- `query2.finance.yahoo.com` is an interchangeable mirror.

A plain `curl` (or any HTTP client) works — no proxy needed. Under restricted egress, run it through `browserless_function`. That runs in a **browser page context**, so a bare `fetch` has no egress until the page is navigated on-origin: `page.goto` the API host first, then `page.evaluate` a same-origin `fetch`:

```js
export default async function ({ page }) {
  await page.goto('https://query1.finance.yahoo.com/', {
    waitUntil: 'domcontentloaded',
  });
  const data = await page.evaluate(async () => {
    const r = await fetch(
      '/v1/finance/screener/predefined/saved?scrIds=day_gainers&count=5&formatted=false',
    );
    return r.json();
  });
  // project inside the function — don't ship the raw payload back
  const d = data.finance.result[0];
  return {
    data: { title: d.title, total: d.total, quotes: d.quotes },
    type: 'application/json',
  };
}
```

### 2. Parse the result

The payload is `finance.result[0]` with:

- `title` → `"Day Gainers"`
- `total` → full count of matching stocks (e.g. 173); `count` → how many were returned
- `quotes[]` → already sorted by `regularMarketChangePercent` descending

For each `quotes[i]` read:

- `symbol`, `shortName` (fallback `longName`)
- `regularMarketPrice`, `regularMarketChange`, `regularMarketChangePercent`
- `regularMarketVolume`, `marketCap`, `fullExchangeName`
- `quoteType` (will be `"EQUITY"` — predefined gainers are single stocks, not ETFs/funds), `marketState`

```bash
curl -s "https://query1.finance.yahoo.com/v1/finance/screener/predefined/saved?scrIds=day_gainers&count=5&formatted=false" > /tmp/g.json
node -e '
const fs=require("fs");
const d=JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync("/tmp/g.json","utf8")).finance.result[0];
console.log(d.title, "of", d.total);
d.quotes.slice(0,5).forEach((q,i)=>console.log(`${i+1}. ${q.symbol} ${q.shortName} ${q.regularMarketChangePercent.toFixed(2)}% @ ${q.regularMarketPrice}`));
'
```

(If you fetched via `browserless_function`, `data.finance.result[0]` is already the parsed object — drop the outer `JSON.parse`.)

### 3. Emit the ranked list

Take the first N quotes (already in descending-percent order) and shape them into the Expected Output below. Done — no pagination needed for a top-N request.

### Browser fallback (only if the API is unreachable)

The API has no auth and no anti-bot, so the browser path should rarely be needed. If you must, one `browserless_agent` call (the session persists across calls, keyed by `proxy`/`profile` — nothing to release):

```jsonc
// browserless_agent commands (no proxy arg)
{ "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/markets/stocks/gainers/", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } },
{ "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 3500 } },   // table hydrates after load
{ "method": "screenshot", "params": { "fullPage": false } }
```

The page renders the same "Top Stock Gainers Today" table (Symbol / Name / Price / Change / Change % / Volume). The bare `yahoofinance.com` domain 301-redirects to `finance.yahoo.com`. Prefer the screenshot (read with vision) or an `evaluate` that parses the table rows over a raw `text`/`html` grab — the page body is mostly Yahoo nav chrome and sometimes leads with an "Oops, something went wrong" fragment even when the table is present. Validated 2026-05-31: the rendered table (DELL 420.91 / +103.86 / +32.76% / 38.022M) matched the API row exactly.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **`day_gainers` is filtered, not the raw top %.** The predefined screener applies Yahoo's built-in floors (US region, minimum price, minimum intraday market cap, minimum volume). So the #1 row may be a large-cap up 30%, while a micro-cap up 85% won't appear. For broader/unfiltered movers use a different `scrIds`: `small_cap_gainers` (verified: surfaced REPL +85.68% vs. day_gainers' top of +32.76%), or build a custom screener (see crumb gotcha). Pick the list that matches the user's intent and **state which list you used** in your answer.
- **Predefined screener (`/v1/finance/screener/predefined/saved`) needs NO crumb.** A plain GET returns 200 (verified with and without a residential proxy). It sets `A1/A3` cookies in the response but does not require any on the request.
- **Custom screeners DO need a crumb + cookie.** The unfiltered query endpoint `POST /v1/finance/screener?crumb=...` requires first fetching a session cookie from any Yahoo page, then `GET /v1/test/getcrumb` with that cookie. Only go down this path if a predefined `scrIds` doesn't fit; for "top N gainers" the predefined list is sufficient and crumb-free.
- **`formatted=false` vs default.** Default responses wrap every numeric in `{raw, fmt}`. Pass `formatted=false` for plain numbers, which is simpler to parse.
- **`count` caps the rows; `total` is the full match count.** `count=5` returns 5 quotes but `total` may read 173 — don't mistake `total` for "stocks up today."
- **Results are pre-sorted descending by percent change.** No client-side sort needed; `quotes[0]` is the top performer.
- **Market-closed = static, last-session values.** On weekends/holidays `marketState` is `CLOSED` and the percentages reflect the last trading session's close (the list is stable, not live). Re-fetching returns identical numbers until the next session.
- **All rows are `quoteType: "EQUITY"`** — the predefined gainers list is single stocks only, so it already satisfies "single stocks" (no ETFs/funds to filter out).
- **API host ≠ web host.** The data lives on `query1`/`query2.finance.yahoo.com`; the human page is `finance.yahoo.com`. The bare `yahoofinance.com` 301-redirects to `finance.yahoo.com`.
- **No anti-bot wall observed.** Pre-run probe reported no antibots; API fetched 200 both with and without a proxy; the gainers page loaded directly with no consent/captcha interstitial. No stealth or residential `proxy` arg was required for any successful step.
