# Wander Search & Extract Listings

## Purpose

Discover vacation-rental listings across wander.com and extract the **complete metadata and full image gallery** from any listing's detail page. Returns structured property data — name, slug, geo-coordinates, address, bedroom/bathroom/occupancy counts, bed configuration, amenities, check-in/out times, nightly-rate range, 90-day daily pricing & availability, local recommendations — plus the entire media gallery (every room photo, hero shot, floor plan, and video, with all resolution variants). Read-only; never books, never submits payment. Wander explicitly welcomes AI agents (`robots.txt` sets `Content-Signal: ai-train=yes, search=yes, ai-input=yes` and ships an `/llms.txt` plus per-property markdown mirrors), so the optimal path is a plain `browserless_agent` `goto` of the SSR surfaces — no UI interaction, no authentication, and no anti-bot stealth required. Parse the JSON-LD and RSC medias in-page and return a compact projection.

## When to Use

- Building a catalog/index of every Wander property (3,397 property URLs are enumerable from the sitemap).
- Extracting one listing's full detail record — all metadata + the complete photo/video gallery — for ingestion, comparison, or display.
- Monitoring pricing and 90-day availability for specific properties.
- Filtering/browsing listings by category (Beachfront, Mountain, Urban, Desert, Wine, Ski).
- Anywhere you'd otherwise script a browser against Wander — the HTTP/markdown surfaces are faster, cheaper, and structurally stable.

## Workflow

Wander's web UI is a Next.js (App Router) app, but it server-renders a complete schema.org `VacationRental` JSON-LD block and embeds the full property data (including the entire media gallery) inside the RSC flight payload of the detail-page HTML. It also publishes an LLM-friendly markdown mirror for every property. **The recommended method is to fetch these SSR surfaces via `browserless_agent` `goto`** (parsing in-page) — no UI interaction is needed for either search or full extraction. Honor the published rate limit of **1 request/second** (`/llms.txt`).

### Step 1 — Discover listings (pick a search surface)

- **Full enumeration (best for "all listings"):** `goto` `https://www.wander.com/sitemap.xml` and read it with a `text` command (~6,011 `<loc>` entries; filter for `/property/` → ~3,397 listing URLs). The slug is the last path segment, e.g. `wander-june-lake`.
- **Browse + category filter:** `goto` `https://www.wander.com/locations` — server-rendered with ~3,281 `/property/{slug}` links and the six categories (Beachfront, Mountain, Urban, Desert, Wine, Ski). Also lists destinations/travel guides.
- **Query search (destination / dates / guests):** the search form on `/` and `/locations` ("Where? / When? / Who?") drives the same `/locations` result set client-side; for programmatic use, enumerate from the sitemap and filter on the extracted metadata (geo, category, bedrooms, availability) rather than driving the form.

Dedupe slugs; each maps to `https://www.wander.com/property/{slug}`.

### Step 2 — Load the detail page

```json
{
  "method": "goto",
  "params": {
    "url": "https://www.wander.com/property/{slug}",
    "waitUntil": "load",
    "timeout": 45000
  }
}
```

A live property returns `200` with a ~700 KB HTML document (a real browser follows any `308` for legacy/renamed slugs automatically; see gotchas). Parse Steps 3–4 in-page with a single `evaluate` command so the ~700 KB HTML never crosses the wire — the `browserless_function`/`evaluate` text return caps at ~200 KB, so project down to the fields below rather than returning raw HTML.

### Step 3 — Extract structured metadata from the JSON-LD block

Inside the Step 2 `evaluate`, parse the single `<script type="application/ld+json">…</script>` block (`@type: VacationRental`). It is the authoritative metadata source and is present on every live property page:

- `identifier` → slug, `name`, `url`, `description`
- `latitude`, `longitude`, `address` (`streetAddress`, `addressLocality`, `addressRegion`, `postalCode`, `addressCountry`)
- `checkinTime`, `checkoutTime`
- `containsPlace.numberOfBedrooms`, `.numberOfBathroomsTotal`, `.occupancy.value` (sleeps), `.floorSize.value` (sq ft), `.numberOfRooms`
- `containsPlace.bed[]` → `[{typeOfBed, numberOfBeds}]`
- `containsPlace.amenityFeature[]` → list of `{name, value}` (e.g. `wifi:true`, `hotTub:true`, `petsAllowed:false`, `parkingType:"Free"`, `poolType:"Outdoor"`)
- `image[]` → **10 representative images only** (a subset of the full gallery — do NOT treat this as the complete gallery)

### Step 4 — Extract the FULL media gallery from the RSC payload

The complete gallery is embedded in the detail HTML's RSC flight data, split into one `"medias":[ … ]` array **per room/section** (Showcase, Exterior, Kitchen, each Bedroom, etc.). Do this union+dedup in-page inside the same `evaluate` (over `document.documentElement.outerHTML`) and return only the projected media list — never ship the raw ~700 KB payload back. To get every image/video:

1. Unescape the flight data: replace the literal two-character sequence `\"` with `"` across the HTML.
2. Find every occurrence of `"medias":[`, bracket-match each array to its closing `]`, and `JSON.parse` each.
3. **Union all arrays and dedupe by `assetId`** — this is the complete gallery. (Nearby/"similar" property cards on the page do NOT contribute `medias` arrays, so the union is scoped to the current listing. Validate by confirming the JSON-LD `image[]` asset IDs are a subset of your union — they always are.)

Each media object contains:

- `assetId`, `id`, `type` (`ROOM`, `HERO`, `FLOOR_PLAN`, `HERO_ANIMATED_VIDEO`, `HOME_TOUR_VIDEO`, `HOME_SNEAK_PEEK_VIDEO`), `order`, `width`, `height`
- Resolution URLs (webp + png): `fullResUrl` (`/{assetId}/fullres.webp`), `highResUrl` (`2440`), `mediumResUrl` (`1200`), `lowResUrl` (`640`), `lowestResUrl` (`320`)

Sort by `order`; pick `fullResUrl` (or `highResUrl`) for the canonical image URL. Filter `type` to `ROOM`/`HERO`/`FLOOR_PLAN` for still photos, or keep the video types separately. Typical galleries hold ~60–150 unique media.

### Step 5 — Enrich with the markdown mirror (pricing, availability, local recs)

The `.md` is a plain-text mirror. Two equivalent ways to read it:

- Simplest — a `goto` to the `.md` URL followed by a `text` command:
  ```json
  { "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "https://www.wander.com/property/{slug}.md", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } },
  { "method": "text", "params": { "selector": "body" } }
  ```
- Or a `browserless_function` that navigates the origin first, then runs a **same-origin** `fetch` in-page (a bare `fetch` has no egress until the page is navigated — `page.goto` the origin, then `page.evaluate`):
  ```js
  export default async function ({ page }) {
    await page.goto('https://www.wander.com/', { waitUntil: 'load' });
    const md = await page.evaluate(async () =>
      (await fetch('/property/{slug}.md')).text(),
    );
    return { data: md, type: 'text/plain' };
  }
  ```

A compact (~14 KB) markdown document adding fields not in the JSON-LD:

- **Nightly rate range** (USD, before taxes/fees), **Next Available** date, **Available Days** count
- **Daily Pricing (next 90 days)** — one line per date: `Jun 8, 2026: $822 (Available)` / `(Not Available)`
- **Local recommendations** — Dining, Activities & Attractions, Local Services (curated blurbs)
- **Additional Information** notices (shipping, occupancy, hot-tub, pets, smoking) and Guest Services
- **Property ID** (the internal CMS id, e.g. `cm7j97um9067tl0x1ychp5t5u`) and **Hero Image** URL

### Step 6 — Merge and emit

Combine the JSON-LD metadata, the deduped media gallery, and the markdown pricing/availability/recs into one record (see Expected Output).

### Browser fallback (only if the SSR parse ever breaks — not observed)

If the in-page parse ever fails, drive the UI in one `browserless_agent` call (a plain call is sufficient — no `proxy`/stealth arg needed):

1. `{ "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "https://www.wander.com/property/{slug}", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } }` then `{ "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 2500 } }`.
2. `{ "method": "text", "params": { "selector": "head" } }` to read the JSON-LD, then `click` the photo grid to open the gallery modal and `{ "method": "snapshot" }` to harvest image refs from the `urlMap` (confirm the grid ref via `snapshot` if it misses). Note the modal repeats images across section tabs (the "X photos" counter, e.g. "115", double-counts; unique is ~59–64) — dedupe by asset ID. The HTML/RSC parse in Steps 3–4 is strictly better and avoids this.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **No anti-bot, no auth, no proxy needed.** Pre-run probe and direct testing both confirmed: a plain load (no residential proxy, no stealth) returns `200` with the full SSR payload for both `/property/{slug}` and `.md`. The successful runs set **no** `proxy` arg on the `browserless_agent` call. Wander actively invites agents (`Content-Signal: ai-train=yes, search=yes, ai-input=yes`).
- **Respect the published rate limit: 1 request/second** (`/llms.txt`). Contact is `ai@wander.com`.
- **`wander.com` → `www.wander.com` (308).** Always use the `www.` host to avoid an extra redirect hop.
- **JSON-LD `image[]` is only 10 representative images — NOT the full gallery.** The complete gallery (often 60–150 media) lives only in the `"medias"` arrays of the RSC payload. Using `image[]` alone silently undercounts photos ~6–15×.
- **The gallery is split across many `medias` arrays (one per room/section), not a single array.** Taking only the first/largest array undercounts (e.g. Wander June Lake's first array has 8, but the union of all 16 section arrays is 64). Always union + dedupe by `assetId`.
- **RSC flight data is backslash-escaped.** Inside `self.__next_f.push(...)`, quotes appear as the literal `\"`. Unescape (`\"` → `"`) before regex/JSON parsing the `medias` objects.
- **The naïve "image has a 2440.webp variant" heuristic is unreliable** for gallery membership: only the few hero images are preloaded at 2440 (Wander June Lake had 59 with a 2440 variant, but Wander Tulum had only 4). Use the `medias` arrays, not resolution-tier guessing.
- **The browser gallery's photo counter double-counts.** The modal shows a "Showcase" tab plus per-room tabs that repeat the same images; the displayed total (e.g. "115") is larger than the ~59–64 unique assets. Dedupe by asset ID.
- **Some property slugs `308`-redirect or are stale.** The example slugs in `/llms.txt` are illustrative and can drift — `wander-big-sur-cliffs` currently `308`-redirects. Trust the sitemap/`/locations` for live slugs; follow redirects or skip on non-200.
- **`property_id` (markdown) ≠ `assetId`/`identifier`.** The markdown "Property ID" is an internal CMS id (`cm…`); the JSON-LD `identifier` is the URL slug; `assetId` values are per-image. Keep them distinct.
- **`.md` daily pricing reflects rates even on unavailable dates.** Each day line carries a price plus an `(Available)`/`(Not Available)` flag — a price does not imply bookability; read the flag.
- **Image asset URLs are unauthenticated and hotlinkable** on `assets.wander.com` (`/{assetId}/{fullres|2440|1200|640|320}.{webp|png}`). No signing/expiry observed.
- **`sitemap.xml` and `.md`/HTML sometimes return empty over a flaky proxy hop;** a plain `browserless_agent` call with no `proxy` arg is reliable and faster here since there's no anti-bot to evade.

## Expected Output

A single merged record per listing. `media[]` is the full deduped gallery; `images[]` is the convenience list of still-photo URLs.
