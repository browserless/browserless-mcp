# Is It Cloudy? — Sky Conditions, Visibility & Blue-Sky Check

## Purpose

Return current sky conditions for a US location — cloud-cover layers (METAR `CLR/FEW/SCT/BKN/OVC/VV` codes with base heights), surface visibility, a plain-English summary ("Clear", "Mostly Cloudy", "Fog"), and a derived "can you see blue sky?" boolean with a confidence qualifier. Read-only. Pulls from the National Weather Service's free, unauthenticated JSON API at `api.weather.gov`; never logs in, never posts.

## When to Use

- Answer "is it cloudy right now?", "can I see the stars tonight?", "how foggy is it at the airport?"
- Astrophotography / stargazing readiness checks ("is the sky clear enough?")
- Aviation-adjacent ground checks (visibility in meters/miles, ceiling base height)
- Solar-panel output sanity checks (cloud-cover percentage proxy)
- Outdoor-event go/no-go decisions where overcast vs. partial-cloud matters
- Any UI that needs a short, structured sky-state field per location

## Workflow

**Recommended path: NWS JSON API.** `api.weather.gov` is a public, unauthenticated REST service over GeoJSON. No cookies, no anti-bot, no JS rendering, no rate-limit auth — only requirement is a descriptive `User-Agent` header identifying the caller (NWS uses it for abuse contact; missing UA returns 403). A residential proxy is **not** required. Three sequential GETs per location; ~200ms each. The HTML site (`forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php`) is the browser fallback at the end of this section, but it's strictly inferior — same data, more turns, harder to parse, and the visibility field is buried in plain text.

1. **Resolve location to lat/lon.** NWS only accepts coordinates (4 decimals max, e.g. `40.7128,-74.0060`). Caller supplies coords directly, or geocode an address/place via any geocoder (Census, Nominatim, Mapbox). NWS does **not** geocode for you.

2. **Get the grid + nearest stations URL:**

   ```
   GET https://api.weather.gov/points/{lat},{lon}
   User-Agent: your-app (contact@example.com)
   Accept: application/geo+json
   ```

   Response (`properties`):
   - `gridId`, `gridX`, `gridY` — the forecast office grid cell.
   - `observationStations` — URL listing observation stations ordered by proximity.
   - `forecast` / `forecastHourly` — text-forecast URLs (used in step 5b fallback).
   - `relativeLocation.properties.{city,state}` — nearest named place (good for the response label).
   - `timeZone` — IANA tz of the point.

   **Non-US coords** → HTTP 404 with `type: ".../problems/InvalidPoint"`. Return a `not_supported_region` outcome (see Expected Output).

3. **List nearby stations:**

   ```
   GET {observationStations}    # = https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/{office}/{x},{y}/stations
   ```

   `features[]` is ordered nearest-first. Pull `features[0].properties.stationIdentifier` (4-letter ICAO, e.g. `KNYC`, `KBFI`).

4. **Get the latest observation:**

   ```
   GET https://api.weather.gov/stations/{stationId}/observations/latest
   ```

   Key `properties` fields:
   - `textDescription` — short English summary: `"Clear"`, `"Mostly Cloudy"`, `"Light Rain"`, `"Fog"`, …
   - `cloudLayers[]` — array of `{amount, base:{value, unitCode:"wmoUnit:m"}}`. `amount` is one of:
     - `CLR` / `SKC` — sky clear (0/8 octas)
     - `FEW` — 1/8–2/8 octas
     - `SCT` — 3/8–4/8 octas (scattered)
     - `BKN` — 5/8–7/8 octas (broken / mostly cloudy)
     - `OVC` — 8/8 octas (overcast)
     - `VV` — vertical visibility (sky obscured by fog/precip; `base` = ceiling of obscuration)
     - Empty array `[]` — station has no sky sensor; fall back to step 5.
   - `visibility.value` — meters. Statute miles = `value / 1609.344`. `null` when no METAR vis report.
   - `icon` — `https://api.weather.gov/icons/land/{day|night}/{skc|few|sct|bkn|ovc|fog|...}` — the 3-letter slug after `day/`/`night/` mirrors the highest-coverage `cloudLayers.amount` (lowercased) for non-precip conditions.
   - `timestamp` — ISO-8601 of the observation. Treat anything > 2h old as **stale**; iterate to the next station in step 3's list.
   - `temperature`, `dewpoint`, `relativeHumidity`, `windSpeed`, `windDirection`, `barometricPressure` — bonus context.

5. **Derive "can you see blue sky?"** from `cloudLayers` (use the highest-coverage layer, since lower layers occlude higher):

   | Highest `amount` | `can_see_blue_sky` | `qualifier`                              |
   | ---------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
   | `CLR` or `SKC`   | `true`             | `"fully clear"`                          |
   | `FEW`            | `true`             | `"mostly blue with a few clouds"`        |
   | `SCT`            | `true`             | `"partial blue sky"`                     |
   | `BKN`            | `false`            | `"mostly cloudy — limited blue patches"` |
   | `OVC`            | `false`            | `"overcast"`                             |
   | `VV`             | `false`            | `"obscured (fog/precip)"`                |

   If `cloudLayers` is empty / station has no sky sensor:
   5a. Re-issue step 3 against `features[1..n]` until a station returns non-empty `cloudLayers` (most ASOS stations do; many AWOS stations don't).
   5b. **Last resort — forecast text:** `GET https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/{office}/{x},{y}/forecast`, take `properties.periods[0].shortForecast` (`"Sunny"`, `"Partly Cloudy"`, `"Mostly Cloudy"`, `"Cloudy"`, `"Fog"`, …) and map by string match. Mark the response `source: "forecast-shortForecast"` so the caller knows it's a forecast, not an observation.

6. **Format the response** per the JSON schema in Expected Output. Always include `observed_at` and `station_id` so the consumer can detect stale data.

### Browser fallback

Only when `api.weather.gov` is unreachable (NWS does occasionally 500/503 during ingest cycles). Open `https://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat={lat}&lon={lon}` with `browserless_agent` (`{ "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "…", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } }`, no proxy/solve needed — weather.gov has zero anti-bot). The "Current Conditions" card on the right shows:

- Big text label (`Mostly Cloudy`, `Sunny`, …) → maps 1:1 to `textDescription`.
- "Visibility" row in `Xkm (Ymi)` — parse with `/Visibility\s+([\d.]+)\s*km\s+\(([\d.]+)\s*mi\)/`.
- "Sky Cover" not always present in the table; if absent, infer from the label.
- Station id appears in the small grey text below the label: `Conditions at {Station Name}, {ST} ({CALLSIGN})`.

A single `browserless_agent` `goto` followed by a `text` read of `body` (`{ "method": "text", "params": { "selector": "body" } }`) is usually enough — the page is plain HTML, no JS gating. Do not click anywhere; the API path is so much cheaper that any clicks indicate the API path should have been retried instead.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **`User-Agent` is mandatory.** Direct calls without UA return `403 Forbidden — User-Agent header is required`. Set something descriptive: `my-app (contact@example.com)`. A real browser (via `browserless_agent`) attaches a UA automatically; raw `curl` with no UA gets blocked.
- **US-only coverage (incl. PR/USVI/Guam/AK/HI).** Non-US lat/lon → HTTP 404 with body `{"type":".../problems/InvalidPoint","title":"Data Unavailable For Requested Point","status":404}`. Detect and return `not_supported_region` rather than retrying.
- **Stations can be missing sky data.** Many AWOS-only stations report visibility + temp but emit `cloudLayers: []`. Always iterate to the next-nearest station before falling back to the forecast text.
- **Stale observations are common.** Some stations report hourly, a few only every 3h. Always check `properties.timestamp` against now; reject > 2h old. Major airport ASOS (`KJFK`, `KORD`, `KLAX`, `KSEA`, `KBOS`, `KSFO`, `KATL`, `KDEN`, `KDFW`, `KMIA`, `KIAH`, `KMSP`, `KPHX`, `KMCO`, `KPHL`, `KIAD`, `KDCA`, `KBWI`, `KSLC`, `KLAS`) report every 5 min and are almost always fresh.
- **Visibility is in meters, not miles.** `visibility.unitCode === "wmoUnit:m"`. Statute miles = `value / 1609.344` (NOT `1000`). Aviation max-vis cap is **16,090 m** (10 statute miles); values at exactly 16090 mean "10+ mi" not literally 16.09 km.
- **`cloudLayers` is METAR-ordered low-to-high.** First element is the lowest layer. When deriving "highest amount" for the blue-sky check, take the **maximum coverage rank** (CLR < FEW < SCT < BKN < OVC < VV) across layers, NOT just the last entry — METAR cloud reporting can stop at the first OVC because higher layers are obscured by definition, so the **first OVC or BKN at the lowest height is what dominates the observer's view**.
- **`VV` is not a cloud layer — it's vertical visibility into obscuration.** Treat as "sky obscured" (fog, heavy snow, smoke). `base.value` here is the height to which an observer can see vertically, NOT a cloud base.
- **`icon` URL slug is reliable for at-a-glance display but is lossy.** A `bkn` icon will be served for both `BKN` and "Mostly Cloudy" forecast text — don't reverse-engineer the exact cloudLayers from the icon path. Use `cloudLayers[]` as the source of truth; use `icon` only for UI thumbnails.
- **Hourly forecast endpoint occasionally returns HTTP 500.** Observed during iteration: `GET /gridpoints/OKX/33,42/forecast/hourly` → 500 while `GET /gridpoints/OKX/33,42/forecast` (non-hourly) → 200 on the same grid. Always retry once; if still failing, use the 7-period (non-hourly) forecast endpoint. The points + stations + observations chain (steps 2–4) is rock-solid; only the gridded forecast endpoints flake.
- **`Cache-Control` matters for cost.** `/points` and `/gridpoints/.../stations` are `max-age=86400` (24h) — geocoding is permanent for a given lat/lon, so cache aggressively. `/observations/latest` is `max-age=120` (2 min). A naïve caller redoing the points lookup on every request is 3× more requests than needed.
- **Coordinate precision is capped at 4 decimals.** `api.weather.gov/points/40.71281,-74.00601` → 301 redirect to `…/40.7128,-74.006`. Pre-round before requesting to skip the redirect.
- **Station IDs are 3- or 4-letter ICAO**, occasionally numeric for mesonet stations (`E1234`). The full URL `https://api.weather.gov/stations/{id}/observations/latest` works for both.
- **No API key, no auth header, no rate-limit auth.** NWS publishes a courtesy guideline of ≤ 5 req/s per source IP. Any sane client stays well under this. Do not retry-loop on 5xx — back off 1s.
- **Browser path is unnecessary 99% of the time.** Only meaningful failure mode for the API is a multi-minute NWS outage (rare; check `status.weather.gov`). Don't burn turns on the browser fallback unless the API has been 5xx-ing for ≥ 2 minutes.

## Expected Output

The skill produces one of five outcome shapes. The top-level `outcome` field is the discriminator.

### 1. `observed` — happy path: station data fresh and complete

    "dewpoint_c": 18.3,
    "relative_humidity_pct": 51.3
  }
}
```

### 2. `observed` — broken/overcast example with multiple layers

```json
{
  "outcome": "observed",
  "location": {
    "lat": 47.6062,
    "lon": -122.3321,

  },
  "icon_url": "https://api.weather.gov/icons/land/day/bkn?size=medium",
  "source": "observation"
}
```

### 3. `forecast_fallback` — station had no `cloudLayers`, used `shortForecast`

```json
{
  "outcome": "forecast_fallback",
  "location": {
    "lat": 35.687,
    "lon": -105.9378,

  "visibility": null,
  "icon_url": null,
  "source": "forecast-shortForecast",
  "forecast_period_name": "This Afternoon"
}
```

### 4. `stale` — most recent obs is > 2h old after exhausting nearby stations

```json
{
  "outcome": "stale",
  "location": {
    "lat": 64.8401,
    "lon": -147.72,
    "label": "Fairbanks, AK",
    "timezone": "America/Anchorage"
  },
  "tried_stations": ["PAFA", "PAEI", "PAIM"],
  "newest_observed_at": "2026-05-18T08:00:00+00:00",
  "age_hours": 8.85,
  "reason": "No station within forecast grid reported within the last 2h"
}
```

### 5. `not_supported_region` — non-US lat/lon

```json
{
  "outcome": "not_supported_region",
  "location": { "lat": 51.5074, "lon": -0.1278 },
  "reason": "NWS api.weather.gov serves US states, territories, and adjacent marine zones only.",
  "nws_error": {
    "type": "https://api.weather.gov/problems/InvalidPoint",
    "title": "Data Unavailable For Requested Point",
    "status": 404
  }
}
```
