      Sections are server-rendered Next.js pages that return HTTP 200 on a plain

# Navigate the Framer Community

## Purpose

Navigate the Framer Community hub (`framer.com/community/`) and move from it to any of its destinations — the Feed, Hype, Marketplace, Gallery, Members, Contests, an individual post, or a creator profile — returning the community's navigation map plus the identity (title, URL, handle) of whatever destination you land on. Read-only: this skill never logs in, posts, likes, follows, or comments.

## When to Use

- You need the canonical URL map of the Framer Community sections (Feed / Hype / Marketplace / Gallery / Members / Contests) to drive further navigation.
- You want to open the latest Feed posts and jump to the authoring creator's profile.
- You need to resolve a creator handle to their canonical profile URL, or a post ID to its page.
- Any time another skill needs a reliable "land me on section/post/creator X inside Framer Community" primitive.

## Workflow

Framer Community is a server-rendered Next.js app with **no anti-bot and no login wall** for read access (the one exception is _Activity_ — see gotchas). The fastest, most reliable path is to **navigate directly to the known deep-link URLs below — you do not need to click through the nav** to reach a section. Use the browser only to (a) enumerate the _dynamic_ Feed/creator content, which changes every few minutes, and (b) resolve handles/IDs to canonical URLs. A residential proxy and stealth are **not** required (confirmed across two converged runs on a plain session).

Canonical destination URLs (all return HTTP 200 on a bare session):

| Section     | URL                                                | Notes                                                                                   |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Hub         | `https://www.framer.com/community/`                | 307-redirects to `/community/feed/`                                                     |
| Feed        | `https://www.framer.com/community/feed/`           | tabs: `?tab=for-you` (default), `?tab=following` (login-gated)                          |
| Hype        | `https://www.framer.com/community/hype/`           |                                                                                         |
| Activity    | `https://www.framer.com/community/activity/`       | **login-gated** — redirects to `login.framer.com` when logged out                       |
| Marketplace | `https://www.framer.com/community/marketplace/`    | templates + plugins                                                                     |
| Gallery     | `https://www.framer.com/community/gallery/`        | sites built with Framer                                                                 |
| Members     | `https://www.framer.com/community/members/`        |                                                                                         |
| Contests    | `https://www.framer.com/community/contests/`       | redirects to the currently-active contest, e.g. `/community/contests/agents-hackathon/` |
| Post        | `https://www.framer.com/community/posts/{postId}/` | `{postId}` is a ~22-char base62 id                                                      |
| Creator     | `https://www.framer.com/@{handle}/`                | canonical; `/community/creator/@{handle}/` 307-redirects here                           |

Recommended steps:

1. **Open the hub** and confirm the redirect:
   ```json
   {
     "commands": [
       {
         "method": "goto",
         "params": {
           "url": "https://www.framer.com/community/",
           "waitUntil": "load",
           "timeout": 45000
         }
       },
       { "method": "evaluate", "params": { "content": "location.href" } }
     ]
   }
   ```
   The `evaluate` returns the resolved URL under `.value` (→ `https://www.framer.com/community/feed/`).
2. **Dismiss the cookie banner** if present — there is an "Okay" button (a ref in the `snapshot`). It can sit over feed content, so `click` it before touching feed items.
3. **Read the left-hand navigation** to harvest the section map. The `snapshot` command returns a clean accessibility tree (~215 refs); the section links live under two headings — `Explore` (Feed, Hype, Activity) and `Community` (Marketplace, Gallery, Members, Contests). The snapshot ref→URL table gives you each href directly. Alternatively just use the static table above.
4. **To navigate to a section**, prefer a `goto` to `<section-url>` (deep-link) over clicking — it's one step and avoids the cookie overlay.
5. **To reach a creator from the Feed**: read the Feed via a `text` read of the main content (or `snapshot`) — it cleanly surfaces author name, handle, post text, timestamp, like/comment counts. The first post is the newest (reverse-chronological). `click` the author's name/avatar, then read `location.href` via `evaluate` — it resolves to `https://www.framer.com/@{handle}/`. You can also skip the click and `goto` `https://www.framer.com/@{handle}/` directly once you have the handle.
6. **To open a post**: `goto` `https://www.framer.com/community/posts/{postId}/`. The post URL is in the Feed `snapshot`'s ref table (the post-card link).
7. **Extract the destination identity** with an `evaluate` of `document.title` + `location.href` (titles follow `"{Name} (@{handle}) – Framer Community"` for creators and `"Post by {Name} – Framer Community"` for posts), and emit the JSON in Expected Output.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **`/community/` 307-redirects to `/community/feed/`** — treat the Feed as the hub landing page.
- **Creator canonical URL is `framer.com/@{handle}/`, NOT `framer.com/community/creator/@{handle}/`.** The `/community/creator/@{handle}/` form works but 307-redirects; always read the resolved URL after navigation rather than assuming the path you requested.
- **`Activity` is login-gated.** When logged out, the nav "Activity" link points at `https://login.framer.com/?origin=framer-web&redirect=...%2Fcommunity%2Factivity%2F`, and opening `/community/activity/` bounces to the login page. Don't expect content there in an unauthenticated session. The `?tab=following` Feed tab is similarly login-gated.
- **`Contests` redirects to the active contest slug.** `/community/contests/` resolved to `/community/contests/agents-hackathon/` during testing; the slug will change as contests rotate, so read the resolved URL/title rather than hardcoding it.
- **The Feed is real-time and dynamic.** The "first/latest post" (and the "Suggested for you" sidebar) changes every few minutes — across two runs the top post went from `@rajeshuiux` to `@themeflow`. Never treat a specific post/creator as stable; only the _section structure and URL patterns_ are stable.
- **Cookie consent overlay.** A "We use cookies…" banner with an "Okay" button can intercept clicks on feed cards. Dismiss it first (or navigate by deep-link URL to avoid the issue entirely).
- **Don't confuse `framer.com/community` with `framer.community`.** `www.framer.community` is a _separate_ Circle.so-hosted discussion forum; this skill targets the first-party `framer.com/community/` hub (Feed/Marketplace/Gallery/Members/Contests). The Marketplace recently merged into this community hub (per Framer's 2026-06 blog post).
- **No anti-bot / no proxy / no stealth needed.** All sections returned HTTP 200 on a plain `browserless_agent` load (no proxy, no stealth) across multiple runs. Snapshots return a real a11y tree (~215 refs) — this is a normal DOM site, not a canvas app, so `snapshot` and a `text` read both work well.
- **Search exists in-nav.** A "Search community" combobox sits at the top of the left nav for finding posts/creators by keyword if you don't already have a handle or post ID.

## Expected Output

A navigation map plus the identity of the destination you landed on. `navigated_to.type` is one of `creator_profile | post | section | login_required`.
