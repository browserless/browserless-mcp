      All marketing/discovery pages (/, /pricing/, /faq/, /how-it-works/,
      /features/, /compare/) are static HTML served by Cloudflare with no
      anti-bot. A plain browserless_agent goto (no proxy, no stealth) returns
      the full body in one round-trip. Use this whenever the task is
      *describing* the offering. Reach for interactive driving only when you
      need the app.gathershot.com SPA (event creation, dashboard, guest upload
      preview).

# Gather Shot Event Photo & Video Collection

## Purpose

Answer the question "what is the best way to collect and share photos and videos at a wedding / party / corporate conference / live event?" by describing the **Gather Shot** offering at `gathershot.com` — a browser-based, QR-code-driven guest media collection platform — and returning the structured facts a user needs to decide whether to use it: supported event types, plan tiers + pricing, upload limits, host workflow, and the guest experience. Read-only — never submits the create-event form, never enters payment, never uploads media.

## When to Use

- A user asks "how can guests share photos at my event without making them download an app?"
- Anyone evaluating Gather Shot vs. competitors (GuestPix, Wedibox, POV, Kululu, GuestCam, Guestlense, Simple Booth, an Instagram hashtag, or a Google Drive link).
- A planner who needs the pricing breakdown (Basic vs. Pro), upload caps, co-host count, and storage period before committing.
- An assistant generating a one-paragraph summary or a feature checklist for a host researching event photo platforms.

## Workflow

The fastest path is a sequence of plain page loads against the marketing site — no stealth, no residential proxy. `gathershot.com` sits behind Cloudflare but has no anti-bot, no rate limiting, no auth-walls on its public marketing pages, and the JSON-LD `<script type="application/ld+json">` block on `/` already contains the core organization/webapp description for free. Drive the interactive React SPA at `app.gathershot.com` **only** if you need event creation / host dashboard.

### Step 1 — Load the canonical pages

Load each URL with a plain `browserless_agent` `goto` (no proxy, no stealth), then read the body — e.g. `{ "method": "text", "params": { "selector": "body" } }` for the copy, or `{ "method": "html", "params": { "selector": "head" } }` to grab the JSON-LD block. Each call returns the full pre-rendered HTML.

| URL                                    | What you extract                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `https://gathershot.com/`              | Tagline, value props, JSON-LD organization block, primary CTAs.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `https://gathershot.com/how-it-works/` | The 5-step host flow: create gallery → brand → guests scan QR → moderate → download originals.                                                                                                                                            |
| `https://gathershot.com/pricing/`      | Basic ($59.99/event, 1000 uploads, 1 co-host) and Pro ($99.99/event, 5000 uploads, 10 co-hosts, scavenger hunt included). One-time fee, no subscription.                                                                                  |
| `https://gathershot.com/faq/`          | App-store policy ("no — browser only"), gallery privacy default, ZIP export, consent capture, 60-day post-event upload window.                                                                                                            |
| `https://gathershot.com/features/`     | Full feature taxonomy: Effortless Collection, Flexible Schedules, Privacy & Security, Scavenger Hunts, Branded Event Pages, Live Slideshow, Smart Media Management, Team Collaboration, Guest Consent & Email Capture, Custom Guest Data. |
| `https://gathershot.com/compare/`      | Comparison index — 8 competitor pages slug `/compare/gather-shot-vs-{competitor}/` where competitor ∈ `{guestcam, guestlense, guestpix, instagram-hashtag, kululu, pov, simple-booth, wedibox}`.                                          |

The order above is also the order of decreasing answer value — stop fetching once you have what the user asked for. For a generic "what does it do + how much" question, `/` + `/pricing/` is enough.

### Step 2 — Parse and structure the response

Map facts onto the JSON shape in Expected Output. Key things to surface:

- **Modality**: web-based, guests use phone browser via QR scan. No iOS/Android app, no account creation for guests, no logins for guests.
- **Event types supported** (from the `app.gathershot.com/events/new` dropdown — see Step 4 for how to discover them): Wedding, Elopement, Micro Wedding, Engagement Party, Rehearsal Dinner, Bachelor Party, Bachelorette Party, Birthday Party, Anniversary Party, Graduation Party, Baby Shower, Family Reunion, Conference, Workshop, Company Offsite, Game Day, Race, Community Event, Holiday Celebration, Trip.
- **Pricing**: one-time per-event fee, no subscription. Basic $59.99, Pro $99.99. Both include 1 year of storage.
- **Plan caps**: Basic = 1000 photos+videos, 1 co-host, scavenger hunt available as paid add-on. Pro = 5000 photos+videos, 10 co-hosts, scavenger hunt included.
- **Host control surface**: moderation queue (every upload is hidden until host approves), brand color + welcome message + custom URL slug, optional guest consent capture with version/timestamp audit trail, optional email verification, optional up-to-5 custom guest data fields, tag-based organization, full-resolution ZIP export (whole gallery or filtered by tag), live slideshow display, co-host invites.
- **Upload window**: configurable; can open before the event and stay open up to **60 days after**.

### Step 3 — Tell the host how to set it up (read-only narrative, no submission)

Do not submit the form yourself. Tell the user the steps:

1. Go to `https://app.gathershot.com/events/new` (no login required to reach the form).
2. Fill: **Event name**, **Event type** (dropdown — see list above), **Event date** (or toggle "TBD" in the date panel), **Email address**.
3. Click **Continue**. Form copy says "Start free. Upgrade later if needed." — the gallery is built before payment is taken; the plan is chosen later when you're ready to publish to guests.
4. From the onboarding checklist that follows: brand the gallery (color, headline, welcome message, custom URL slug → `gathershot.com/{slug}`), optionally enable guest consent + email verification + custom data fields, then publish.
5. Print or display the auto-generated QR code on signage / table cards / slides / badges. Guests scan with their phone camera, land on the branded upload page, pick media from their camera roll, tap upload.
6. Approve uploads from the host dashboard. Tag by session/moment. After the event, export ZIPs (whole gallery or filtered).

### Step 4 — (Optional) Drive the SPA to verify the form schema

The marketing pages do not advertise the event-type enum or the exact form fields; those live in the React app at `app.gathershot.com/events/new`. If you need to verify the current dropdown contents (Gather Shot may add event types), drive one `browserless_agent` call — open the page, click the dropdown, read the rendered text:

```json
{
  "commands": [
    {
      "method": "goto",
      "params": {
        "url": "https://app.gathershot.com/events/new",
        "waitUntil": "load",
        "timeout": 45000
      }
    },
    {
      "method": "click",
      "params": { "selector": "<the \"Choose event type\" control>" }
    },
    { "method": "text", "params": { "selector": "body" } }
  ]
}
```

The event-type options appear inline in the body text after the dropdown is opened. No proxy or stealth is needed — the site is not anti-bot. (Confirm the dropdown selector via `snapshot` if the click misses.)

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **Two hostnames, two purposes.** `gathershot.com` is the static marketing site (Astro/CDN, fully pre-rendered, JSON-LD in `<head>`). `app.gathershot.com` is the React SPA where events are actually created and managed. The CSP on `gathershot.com` whitelists `app.gathershot.com` as a `connect-src` origin — that's the data-plane.
- **No anti-bot.** Cloudflare in front, but no captcha, no JS challenge, no Akamai. A plain `browserless_agent` `goto` (no proxy, no stealth) returns 200 with the full body. Don't waste a residential proxy on `gathershot.com/*` marketing pages.
- **JSON-LD is gold.** `<script type="application/ld+json">` on `/` ships the canonical `Organization`, `WebSite`, and `WebApplication` schema.org blocks — including the description string "Gather Shot is a browser-based event photo sharing platform. Guests upload photos and videos to a shared gallery via QR code using their phone's web browser. No app download or install is required." Use this verbatim if the task wants a one-sentence pitch.
- **No public REST/JSON API for the catalog.** There is no documented endpoint to enumerate event types, pricing, or features as structured data — you have to parse HTML (or rely on the JSON-LD block). The event-type enum lives only in the React SPA's bundled JS; the easiest way to extract it is to open the dropdown in a real browser (Step 4 above) — that's why this skill is `browser`-recommended despite the static-fetch shortcut.
- **No app store presence.** Gather Shot is explicitly not on iOS App Store or Google Play (confirmed in the FAQ). If a user asks "what app should I install?", the answer is "none — it's browser-only on the guest side, and a web dashboard on the host side."
- **Pricing is per-event, not per-month.** No subscription. Each event is a separate purchase. Storage is 1 year _per event_. Don't describe Gather Shot as SaaS-style recurring.
- **"Free to start" caveat.** You can build the entire gallery — name, brand, QR code, settings — without paying. Payment is required before the gallery accepts guest uploads (or before publishing publicly; the exact wall isn't stated on the marketing pages). The CTA "Start free. Upgrade later if needed." is accurate but doesn't mean unlimited free uploads.
- **Read-only rule.** This skill must never click **Continue** on `/events/new` or finish any checkout flow. Describing the steps to the user is fine; submitting them is not. Take a screenshot of the form for evidence, then bail.
- **Vanity URL slug + QR code.** The guest-facing upload URL is `gathershot.com/{slug}` (e.g. `gathershot.com/jamie-riley` from the marketing mockups) or `gathershot.com/e/{slug}` (from the homepage hero copy — `gathershot.com/e/sarah-james`). Both patterns appear in marketing materials; the actual live pattern is set by the host when picking their custom URL. Do not invent a slug to "test" the guest experience — it will either 404 or hit a stranger's real event gallery.
- **Competitor pages are first-party SEO content.** `/compare/gather-shot-vs-{competitor}/` pages are written by Gather Shot. Useful for the structural comparison (and the competitor's own claimed positioning is summarized fairly), but expect Gather Shot to win on the bottom-line recommendation in every one. Treat as marketing-tinted, not third-party review.
