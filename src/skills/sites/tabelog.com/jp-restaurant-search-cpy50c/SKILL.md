      The Silver award listing at award.tabelog.com/en/restaurants/silver is a
      100-card static HTML page parseable in one fetch — no API or GraphQL
      surface exposed publicly. The detail-page fields (rating, budget,
      online-booking indicator) live only in the rendered HTML on tabelog.com.
      Stealth + residential proxy is required for the detail-page fetches;
      without it Tabelog serves an Akamai-style 'checking your browser'
      interstitial.
  - method: url-param
    rationale: >-
      Tabelog's main search at
      /en/{prefecture}/rstLst/{cuisineCode}/?vac_net=1&srt=rt accepts URL-param
      filtering, but it has no Silver-only filter — joining 'is this restaurant
      Silver?' back to the main-search result requires loading every detail page
      anyway. The award-page-first flow is strictly cheaper.

# Tabelog Award Silver Restaurant Search

## Purpose

Enumerate Tabelog Award Silver winners, filter by user-supplied criteria (prefecture/city, cuisine genre, rating threshold, lunch availability, lunch price ceiling), and for each survivor report whether the restaurant accepts **online reservations directly on tabelog.com** (vs. phone/email only). Returns a structured list with rating, lunch budget, dinner budget, business hours, and `bookable_online_via_tabelog` boolean. Read-only — never submits a reservation.

The Silver tier is a fixed 100-restaurant curated list published annually at `award.tabelog.com/en/restaurants/silver` (Bronze, Gold, etc. live at sibling paths). Because the Silver list is _already_ the curated top-N, "top 100 in Silver" is satisfied automatically — the rating ≥ 3.8 check is still applied as a per-restaurant filter (every Silver winner observed in 2026 had rating ≥ 4.0, but the data is read from the detail page so the user's threshold is enforceable).

## When to Use

- "Find me the best French restaurants in Tokyo open for lunch under ¥50,000 that I can book on Tabelog directly."
- Concierge / trip-planning agents narrowing a Tabelog Award shortlist to a city + cuisine + lunch budget.
- Any query of the form "Silver/Gold/Bronze + prefecture + genre + lunch-or-dinner + price ceiling + bookability."

For non-award restaurants (i.e. any Tokyo Sushi, not just Silver winners), use the main Tabelog search at `tabelog.com/en/{prefecture}/rstLst/{cuisineCode}/?vac_net=1&srt=rt` instead — but that surface is paginated 20-per-page across hundreds of thousands of results and is a different skill.

## Workflow

### 1. Residential-proxy browserless_agent (one persistent session)

Pass `proxy: { proxy: "residential" }` on the `browserless_agent` call — Tabelog serves a CAPTCHA / soft-block from datacenter IPs without it, and an Akamai-friendly residential IP is the only configuration that works consistently. A bare (no-proxy) session typically loads the award listing but stalls on restaurant detail pages with a "checking your browser" interstitial.

A `browserless_agent` session persists across calls, keyed by the `proxy` config — a later call repeating the same `proxy` reconnects to the same warmed browser with its Akamai cookies/session intact. Keep the whole flow — enumerate the award list → parse → per-restaurant detail fetches — inside ONE call's `commands` array (or a small number of calls that each repeat the same `proxy`) so you save round-trips and don't accidentally drop the `proxy`; a call that drops or changes it lands in a different, blocked session. There is no session-release step.

### 2. Enumerate the Silver award list

There are exactly **100 Silver winners** per cycle (the page is not paginated — all 100 cards are present in the initial HTML, but a few are below the fold and only become `is-visible` after a short scroll-into-view animation):

```jsonc
{ "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "https://award.tabelog.com/en/restaurants/silver", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } }
{ "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 2500 } }   // let lazy-load images settle
{ "method": "scroll", "params": { "direction": "down" } }    // nudge any virtualized items below the fold
{ "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 1500 } }
{ "method": "html", "params": { "selector": "body" } }
```

Parse the 100 cards with the regex below against the returned HTML (or fold the regex into an `evaluate` and return only the projection to stay under the result-size cap).

To target other award tiers, swap the path segment: `gold` (~30 winners), `bronze` (~250), `new` (Best New Entry), `regional`, `chefsgold`. Same HTML schema across all six pages.

Parse each card with this regex (one match per restaurant):

```javascript
const cardRe = /<li class="award-rstlst__item[^"]*"[^>]*>([\s\S]*?)<\/li>/g;
// inside each card:
const url = match[1].match(/href="(https:\/\/tabelog\.com\/en\/[^"]+)"/)[1];
const name = match[1].match(
  /<div class="award-rstlst__rst-name">\s*([^<]+?)\s*<\/div>/,
)[1];
const areaGenre = match[1].match(
  /<div class="award-rstlst__area-genre">\s*([^<]+?)\s*<\/div>/,
)[1];
// areaGenre is always "{Genre} / {Prefecture}", e.g. "French / Tokyo"
const badges = [
  ...match[1].matchAll(
    /award-rstlst__award-label is-([a-z\-]+)"><span>([^<]+)</g,
  ),
].map((m) => m[2]);
// badges may be ["SILVER"], ["SILVER","BEST NEW ENTRY"], or include "Club10-4"
```

### 3. Client-side filter by prefecture + genre

`area_genre` is a single string `"{Genre} / {Prefecture}"`. Tokenize on `/`. Both fields are English-canonical regardless of locale — Tabelog normalizes them on this page. Genre strings observed in 2026 Silver:

```
Japanese Cuisine, Sushi, Seafood, Tempura, French, Italian, Spanish,
Innovative, Creative cuisine, Chinese Cuisine, Steak/Teppanyaki,
Yakiniku/Meat dishes (shown as "Yakiniku" on cards), Yakitori/Poultry
(shown as "Yakitori"), Tonkatsu/Fried foods, Unagi, Soba, Udon, Izakaya,
Asian/Ethnic/Curry, Ramen, Other
```

Match the user's "cuisine type" against these with a case-insensitive substring rule (Tabelog's "Italian" vs. user's "italian"/"Italian food"/"Italian cuisine" all match). For prefecture, accept either prefecture name (`Tokyo`) or a nested city/ward (`Shibuya`, `Ebisu`) — the latter requires checking the URL slug instead, since the card only shows prefecture-level granularity. See gotcha on "city vs prefecture" below.

Distribution in 2026 Silver (sanity-check expectations):

| Prefecture                            | Silvers |     | Genre            | Silvers |
| ------------------------------------- | ------- | --- | ---------------- | ------- |
| Tokyo                                 | 49      |     | Japanese Cuisine | 21      |
| Kyoto                                 | 7       |     | Sushi            | 15      |
| Osaka, Fukuoka                        | 3 each  |     | French           | 9       |
| Saitama, Kanagawa, Saga, Ehime, Gunma | 2 each  |     | Chinese Cuisine  | 7       |
| 15 others                             | 1 each  |     | Innovative       | 6       |
|                                       |         |     | Italian          | 5       |

If the user asks for `Tokyo + Italian` you'll get **exactly 1 restaurant** (Megriva). Don't panic — that's the dataset.

### 4. For each surviving restaurant, fetch the detail page and extract metadata

```jsonc
{ "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "<detail url>", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } }
{ "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 2500 } }
{ "method": "text", "params": { "selector": "body" } }
{ "method": "evaluate", "params": { "content": "(()=>document.title)()" } }
```

The `text` result is plain text (no markdown decoration), so match the visible strings directly rather than the `[...](...)` / `**...**` wrappers; get the page `<title>` from the `evaluate`. Extract the four fields:

- **Rating** — the score renders as a bare `4.43` adjacent to a qualitative label (`Excellent|Very good|Good|Average|Below average`); match the number next to that label. It's the 0.00–5.00 score. Every Silver winner observed scored ≥ 4.00, so a `>= 3.8` filter passes them all — but **enforce it anyway** because users may pass higher thresholds (e.g. ≥ 4.3).

- **Budget block** — locate the literal `Budget` heading, then take the next two `JPY …` price strings. **The first is Dinner, the second is Lunch.** (Order is fixed — there are also `Dinner` / `Lunch` icon labels in the `snapshot` tree for verification.) Either may be absent — Lunch is missing for dinner-only restaurants.
  - Parse the JPY string into a `max_lunch_price` integer for the `<50,000` check. `"JPY 30,000 - JPY 39,999"` → 39999. `"JPY 100,000 -"` (open-ended upper) → treat as ≥ 100000 (does NOT pass `<50k`).

- **Business hours** — in the snapshot tree, the row labeled `Business hours` contains a list with `StaticText: Lunch` and `StaticText: Dinner` subheadings, followed by hour ranges. Lunch presence here is more authoritative than the budget-block lunch field for the "open for lunch?" filter. Some restaurants have lunch budget listed but are weekend-only-lunch (e.g. Joël Robuchon: "Lunch · Last entry at 12:30 (Open only on weekends and public holidays)"). Decide whether weekend-only-lunch satisfies the user's intent — default to "yes, this counts as open for lunch."

- **Bookable online via Tabelog** — the single most reliable signal is the **page `<title>`**:
  - If the title contains `Reservation -` (note the leading/trailing spaces), the restaurant is bookable directly on Tabelog. Examples: `"Bia Reservation - Nogizaka/Innovative | Tabelog"`, `"Bon.nu Reservation - Sangubashi/French | Tabelog"`.
  - If the title is just `"{Name} - {Location}/{Cuisine} | Tabelog"`, the restaurant is **not** bookable through Tabelog. Examples: `"Gastronomy Joel Robuchon - Ebisu/French | Tabelog"`, `"Sushi Akira - Hiro o/Sushi | Tabelog"`.
  - Cross-verify against page content: bookable pages contain a `<h2>Online reservation</h2>` heading with the literal text `"Instant reservations, no phone calls."` directly below. Non-bookable pages have a `Reservation availability: Reservations available` row in the Details table (= "they accept phone reservations") but no `Online reservation` heading. **The `Reservation availability` row is a trap — it says "Reservations available" even for phone-only restaurants and is NOT a Tabelog-online-booking signal.**

### 5. Apply final filters and emit

For each restaurant, apply:

- `rating >= user.rating_threshold` (default 3.8)
- `area_genre` matches `user.cuisine` (case-insensitive substring)
- `prefecture` (or city, see gotcha) matches `user.city`
- `lunch_budget present AND max_lunch_price <= user.lunch_price_ceiling` (50000 by default)
- `bookable_online_via_tabelog` is **reported, not filtered** — the user asks whether each survivor is bookable, so include both bookable and non-bookable restaurants with the flag set.

Hard-cap the survivor count at 100 (the Silver list is 100; you'll never exceed it).

### 6. No session-release step

There is nothing to release, and the session is not torn down on return — it persists across calls, keyed by the `proxy` config. Keep the multi-step flow (enumerate → parse → detail fetches) inside one call's `commands` array (repeating the same `proxy` on each call if you split it) so the Akamai cookies and session carry across the detail-page fetches; dropping or changing the `proxy` lands you in a different, blocked session.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **READ-ONLY.** Never click `Reserve` buttons or course-menu booking links on detail pages — they begin a real reservation flow. Stop at the "is this bookable?" determination. Tabelog tokenizes booking attempts to a phone-verified account and a real card flow lives one step beyond the Reserve click.
- **A residential proxy is mandatory.** Without `proxy: { proxy: "residential" }`, restaurant detail pages stall on an Akamai-style "checking your browser" interstitial. The award listing page itself loads on a bare (no-proxy) session, so a partial run may _look_ like it works and then fail on the first detail fetch.
- **"Reservation availability: Reservations available" is NOT an online-booking signal.** It only means the restaurant takes reservations by phone or email. The discriminator for _Tabelog-direct online booking_ is the page title containing `Reservation -` AND a `<h2>Online reservation</h2>` heading on the page. Joël Robuchon, Sushi Akira, Chez Inno all have "Reservations available" in the Details table but **do not** support online booking via Tabelog. Bia and Bon.nu have it in their title and DO.
- **Budget block order is `[Dinner, Lunch]`, never the other way.** If you see only one JPY link in the Budget section, check the adjacent `<img alt="...">` tag to know which meal it represents. Don't infer from order alone when one is missing.
- **Lunch may be listed in Budget but only served on weekends.** Joël Robuchon is the canonical example. If `Business hours` shows the Lunch block as `"Open only on weekends and public holidays"`, surface that string in the output rather than treating it as a fully-open lunch service.
- **"City" vs. "prefecture" mismatch.** The Silver listing's `area_genre` only reports prefecture-level location (e.g. `"French / Tokyo"`). If the user passes a city or ward (e.g. "Shibuya", "Ebisu", "Ginza"), filter further by parsing the URL slug: a restaurant URL like `https://tabelog.com/en/tokyo/A1303/A130302/13009310/` encodes Tokyo → A1303 (Shibuya-Ebisu-Daikanyama area) → A130302 (Ebisu). The breadcrumbs on the detail page give the human-readable area names (e.g. "Ebisu French"). For "Tokyo" prefix, accept any restaurant where `area_genre` ends in `/ Tokyo`.
- **Genre normalization.** Cards show truncated labels: `Yakiniku/Meat dishes` is displayed as `Yakiniku`, `Yakitori/Poultry` as `Yakitori`. User-supplied "Wagyu" or "BBQ" should map to `Yakiniku`; "ramen" stays `Ramen`. Match case-insensitively with a substring or alias table.
- **Price-ceiling parsing.** The Lunch budget string takes one of these shapes: `"JPY N,NNN - JPY M,MMM"` (closed range), `"JPY N,NNN -"` (open-ended high — treat as ≥ N), `"- JPY M,MMM"` (open-ended low). Parse the lower bound `N` and upper bound `M`; pass the `<50000` test iff the upper bound is ≤ 50000 (or use the lower bound when only that's known and consider the restaurant a "maybe").
- **Award badges can stack.** A restaurant card may carry multiple `award-rstlst__award-label is-*` spans, e.g. `is-silver` + `is-new-entry` (Isoda, Ji-Cube) or `is-silver` + a "Club10-4" badge (Ishikawa, Iyuki, Joël Robuchon). Collect them all into a `badges: string[]` field; the user typically just needs `silver`.
- **Award page exposes the form selects (Award / Genre / Prefecture) but the in-page filter is client-side only.** Adding `?genre=sushi&pref=tokyo` to the URL does NOT filter — the URL is unchanged, all 100 cards remain in the DOM, and selecting an option in the form triggers a client-side hide/show. **Skip the form entirely and filter client-side after parsing.** This is what the page itself does anyway.
- **The main Tabelog search (`tabelog.com/en/{prefecture}/rstLst/`) is not a viable alternative for "Silver only."** There is no Silver-only filter on the main search; the only path to "is this restaurant a Silver winner?" is to scrape the award page first and join by restaurant URL. The reverse — search main, then check each restaurant's award status — works but requires loading the detail page for every candidate (the award badge appears on the detail page as `"The Tabelog Award 2026 Silver winner"` text), which is ~10× more expensive than starting from the award page.
- **Tabelog detail page Japanese-language fallback.** Some fields render as Japanese text on the EN page (e.g. address: `東京都目黒区三田1-13-1 恵比寿ガーデンプレイス`). Keep them as-is; agents downstream can translate. The rating, budget, business hours, and online-booking signals are all English-rendered.
- **Genre code → cuisine taxonomy mapping (for completeness)** — Tabelog's cuisine subcategory codes appear in URL slugs:
  - `RC0201` Japanese cuisine, `RC0202` Italian, `RC021101` French, `RC0203` Teppanyaki, `RC0204` Steak, `RC130101` Yakiniku, `RC0301` Sushi, `RC0303` Tempura, `RC0305` Unagi, `RC0801` Chinese cuisine, `RC0901` Ramen, `RC1101` Cafe/Sweets. Useful only if you want to cross-link to the main search for non-award context. Not required for the Silver flow.
