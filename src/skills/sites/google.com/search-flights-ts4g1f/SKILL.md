# Google Flights — Search Cheapest Itineraries

## Purpose

Given an origin airport, a destination airport, and travel date(s), return the
cheapest Google Flights itineraries — each with price, airline(s), total
duration, number of stops, departure/arrival times (with next-day markers), and
a shareable booking link. Works for both one-way and round-trip searches.
**Read-only — never selects a flight or proceeds to booking/payment.**

## When to Use

- "What's the cheapest one-way flight from SFO to JFK on July 15?"
- Round-trip fare comparison between two airports across a date pair.
- Daily/scheduled price monitoring for a route.
- Any flow needing the cheapest fare + itinerary details without booking.

## Workflow

The optimal path is **not** the homepage form — it is a direct `tfs` deep-link
to the results page. Google Flights encodes the entire search (airports, dates,
trip type, passengers, cabin) into a single base64url-encoded protobuf passed as
the `tfs` URL parameter. Build it deterministically, navigate once, read the
rendered results list, sort by price client-side. No form filling, no clicks.

### 1. Build the `tfs` parameter

The `tfs` value is a protobuf serialized in this wire-tag order, then
base64url-encoded (`+`→`-`, `/`→`_`, strip `=` padding):

| Field | Wire type                       | Value                                                                               |
| ----- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `f2`  | varint                          | `0` (seat placeholder)                                                              |
| `f3`  | message (repeated, one per leg) | `{ f2: "YYYY-MM-DD" (date), f13: {f1:1, f2:"<ORIGIN>"}, f14: {f1:1, f2:"<DEST>"} }` |
| `f8`  | varint                          | `1` (passengers — 1 adult)                                                          |
| `f9`  | varint                          | `1` (cabin — 1=economy, 2=premium economy, 3=business, 4=first)                     |
| `f19` | varint                          | **trip type: `1`=round trip, `2`=one way**                                          |

- **One-way** → exactly ONE `f3` leg, `f19=2`.
- **Round-trip** → TWO `f3` legs (the second reverses airports and uses the return date), `f19=1`.

> ⚠️ `f19` is the trip-type field, NOT `f2`. Setting `f19=1` (or omitting it)
> renders round-trip fares even with a single leg — the prices then carry a
> "round trip" label. For one-way you MUST set `f19=2`.

Node builder (drop-in):

```js
function v(n) {
  const o = [];
  while (n > 127) {
    o.push((n & 0x7f) | 0x80);
    n >>>= 7;
  }
  o.push(n & 0x7f);
  return Buffer.from(o);
}
function tag(f, w) {
  return v((f << 3) | w);
}
function vf(f, n) {
  return Buffer.concat([tag(f, 0), v(n)]);
}
function sf(f, s) {
  const b = Buffer.from(s);
  return Buffer.concat([tag(f, 2), v(b.length), b]);
}
function mf(f, b) {
  return Buffer.concat([tag(f, 2), v(b.length), b]);
}
const airport = (c) => Buffer.concat([vf(1, 1), sf(2, c)]);
const leg = (date, from, to) =>
  Buffer.concat([sf(2, date), mf(13, airport(from)), mf(14, airport(to))]);
function tfs({ oneway, origin, dest, depart, ret }) {
  const p = [vf(2, 0), mf(3, leg(depart, origin, dest))];
  if (!oneway) p.push(mf(3, leg(ret, dest, origin)));
  p.push(vf(8, 1), vf(9, 1), vf(19, oneway ? 2 : 1));
  return Buffer.concat(p)
    .toString('base64')
    .replace(/\+/g, '-')
    .replace(/\//g, '_')
    .replace(/=+$/, '');
}
// one-way SFO→JFK 2026-07-15 → "EAAaHhIKMjAyNi0wNy0xNWoHCAESA1NGT3IHCAESA0pGS0ABSAGYAQI"
```

### 2. Navigate to the results URL

```
https://www.google.com/travel/flights/search?tfs=<TFS>&curr=USD&hl=en
```

`&curr=USD` forces USD pricing; `&hl=en` forces English. Drive one
`browserless_agent` call with `proxy: { proxy: "residential" }` (residential
egress keeps currency/locale stable — see gotchas; no hard anti-bot wall):

```jsonc
// browserless_agent  (proxy: { proxy: "residential" }, optionally proxyCountry: "us")
{
  "commands": [
    {
      "method": "goto",
      "params": {
        "url": "https://www.google.com/travel/flights/search?tfs=<TFS>&curr=USD&hl=en",
        "waitUntil": "load",
        "timeout": 45000,
      },
    },
    { "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 4000 } }, // results render 2–4 s AFTER load fires
    { "method": "text", "params": { "selector": "title" } }, // e.g. "San Francisco to New York | Google Flights" — confirms routing
  ],
}
```

### 3. Extract every result row

Read the whole results region in one shot — it is compact (~3 KB) and complete.
Keep this inside the SAME `browserless_agent` call's `commands` array (the
session persists across calls keyed by `proxy`/`profile`; the tfs page state
persists across commands):

```jsonc
{ "method": "text", "params": { "selector": "[role=main]" } }
```

Each flight is a line block, e.g.:
`2:35 PM – 11:20 PM JetBlue 5 hr 45 min SFO–JFK Nonstop 414 kg CO2e … $205`.
Multi-stop rows add `1 stop` and a connection like `50 min PHX`.

Parse per row: depart time, arrive time (a trailing `+1` = next-day arrival),
airline, total duration, stops (`Nonstop`=0 / `N stop(s)`), route `XXX–XXX`,
price `$NNN`.

If you'd rather pull structured rows than parse the flat text, add an
`evaluate` command in the same call:
`{ "method": "evaluate", "params": { "content": "(()=>JSON.stringify([...document.querySelectorAll('li.pIav2d')].map(li=>li.innerText)))()" } }`
— the return lands under `.value`. `li.pIav2d` is the per-row selector for
`querySelectorAll`.

### 4. Sort by price and emit the cheapest

The list defaults to Google's **"Best"** ranking, NOT price — the cheapest fare
usually sits a few rows down. Dedupe (rows are duplicated in the DOM — see
gotchas), sort ascending by price, and return the lowest N. Use the deep-link
URL as the `booking_link`. Emit the JSON schema in **Expected Output**.

### Browser fallback (only if the tfs schema changes)

1. `goto` `https://www.google.com/travel/flights?hl=en&curr=USD` (`waitUntil: "load"`).
2. Set trip type via `select` on the One way / Round trip dropdown, `type` origin →
   `click` the airport suggestion, `type` destination → `click` suggestion, set
   date(s) in the date picker, `click` **Search/Explore**. (Confirm the actual
   selectors via a `snapshot` command if the accessibility labels shift.)
3. From the results page, run steps 3–4 above (identical extraction).

This costs a handful of extra turns but the read/parse logic is unchanged.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **`f19` is the trip-type field, not `f2`.** A single-leg link with `f19=1`
  (or no `f19`) renders ROUND-TRIP fares (prices labeled "round trip"). One-way
  requires `f19=2`. This was the single biggest trap during development.
- **Default sort is "Best", not cheapest.** There is a "Cheapest" tab (shows
  "from $NNN"), but the most robust approach is to read all rows and sort by
  price client-side — the cheapest fare is rarely the first row.
- **`snapshot` is useless here** — the accessibility tree comes back empty and
  is flagged as an error. Never snapshot Google Flights; read the region with a
  `text` command on `[role=main]`.
- **A `text` command on `.pIav2d` returns ONLY the first row.** Use selector
  `[role=main]` to get all rows in one compact (~3 KB) call. The per-row class
  `li.pIav2d` is correct for `querySelectorAll` (i.e. inside an `evaluate`
  command), just not for the `text` method.
- **Result rows are duplicated in the DOM.** Each itinerary appears twice — once
  fully (with airline + `XXX–XXX` airport codes) and once condensed (no airline,
  no codes). When parsing, skip rows lacking an airline name or airport codes,
  then dedupe by (depart, arrive, airline, price).
- **Flight numbers are NOT in the list view.** They only appear after expanding a
  row's chevron (detail panel shows "Operated by … as … flight NNNN"). For a
  cheapest-list result, `flight_numbers` is typically `null` unless you click to
  expand each row. Expanding is read-only and safe, but costs extra turns.
- **Times are local to each airport.** A `+1` suffix on the arrival time means it
  lands the next calendar day. Durations already account for timezone offset
  (e.g. SFO 8:15 AM → JFK 9:00 PM is "9 hr 45 min" across PT→ET).
- **Currency/locale follow the IP unless pinned.** Always append `&curr=USD&hl=en`
  (or your desired currency) so a residential proxy's geo doesn't change the
  currency or language.
- **Stealth:** a `browserless_agent` call with `proxy: { proxy: "residential" }`
  loaded the site cleanly across multiple runs — no captcha, no 403. Residential
  egress is recommended mainly to keep currency/locale stable and avoid anti-bot
  drift, not because a hard wall was hit. Repeat the `proxy` arg on every call —
  the session persists across calls, keyed by `proxy`/`profile`, so the same
  proxy reconnects to the same session (dropping or changing it lands you in a
  different, blank session).
- **No usable JSON API.** Google Flights' internal `batchexecute`/GRPC endpoints
  are obfuscated and unauthenticated-hostile. Don't waste time hunting for one —
  the tfs-encoded results page is the stable surface.
- **Read-only.** Never click "Select flight" or proceed past the results list.
