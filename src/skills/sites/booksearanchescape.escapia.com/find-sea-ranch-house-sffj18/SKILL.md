# Find a House on Sea Ranch Escape

## Purpose

Given user constraints — date range, party size, bedroom count, pet allowance, ocean-view preference, etc. — return one or more Sea Ranch vacation-rental homes from the Sea Ranch Escape catalog (`booksearanchescape.escapia.com`, an Escapia-powered booking portal) with availability, pricing, amenities, and a deep-link to the unit detail page. Read-only — never click "Book Now" or submit the booking form.

## When to Use

- "Find a 3-bedroom house in Sea Ranch for Thanksgiving week 2026, dog-friendly."
- "What's available at The Sea Ranch from July 4–7 for 4 adults?"
- "Cheapest oceanfront 2BR cottage on Sea Ranch under $400/night this fall."
- "List every Sea Ranch Escape property — I'll filter myself."
- A trip-planning agent comparing vacation rentals across coastal Sonoma/Mendocino.

Booking flows (taking payment, holding a slot) are a separate skill — this one stops at the rate-quote / detail page.

## Workflow

The Sea Ranch Escape portal exposes four undocumented but stable URL-parameter endpoints. **Do not drive the booking form** — the form posts to `DesktopDefault.aspx` with ASP.NET `__VIEWSTATE` (rotates per session, painful to script). Every piece of data the form exposes is reachable via these direct GET endpoints instead.

### 1. Enumerate the full catalog (≈30 units across 4 pages)

```
GET https://booksearanchescape.escapia.com/DesktopDefault.aspx?PageID=11977&page_num={1..4}
```

(Equivalent pretty-URL alias for page 1: `/site/PropertyList/11977/default.aspx`.)

Each response embeds a `<ul id="propertyList">` block with one `<li>` per unit. Parse each `<li>` for:

| Field           | XPath / regex anchor                                                                        |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pid`           | `href="/Unit/Details/(\d+)"`                                                                |
| `name`          | `<h3><a href="/Unit/Details/{pid}">{name}</a></h3>`                                         |
| `price_summary` | `<span class="rate">…{value}…</span>` (free-text — "Starts @ 3 Nights $2075/ Weekly $3903") |
| `bedrooms`      | `<dt>Bedrooms:</dt><dd>{n}</dd>`                                                            |
| `bathrooms`     | `<dt>Bathrooms:</dt><dd>{n}</dd>`                                                           |
| `sleeps`        | `<dt>Sleeps:</dt><dd>{n}</dd>`                                                              |
| `pets`          | `<dt>Pets:</dt><dd>{None\|Dogs\|...}</dd>`                                                  |
| `guest_rating`  | `Guest Rating: (\d+)` in the trailing `<p>`                                                 |
| `image_url`     | `<img class="pic" src="//pictures.escapia.com/SEARES/{pid}/{hash}.jpg">`                    |
| `description`   | Trailing `<p>` after stripping the rating image                                             |

Loop `page_num` from 1 to 4 (the pager UI also reports `<TotalPagesLabel>4</TotalPagesLabel>` — read it instead of hardcoding if you want to be safe).

### 2. Check per-unit availability (JSON, day-by-day)

```
GET https://booksearanchescape.escapia.com/Unit/Availability/{pid}?startDate=MM/DD/YYYY&endDate=MM/DD/YYYY
```

Returns `application/json` — an array of one entry per calendar day from `startDate` (inclusive) to `endDate` (inclusive). Entry shape:

```json
{ "S": "A", "M": 3 }
```

| `S`   | Meaning                                                               |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `"A"` | Available                                                             |
| `"U"` | Unavailable                                                           |
| `"I"` | Check-in only (this day can be an arrival but not a mid-stay night)   |
| `"O"` | Check-out only (this day can be a departure but not a mid-stay night) |

`M` is the **minimum stay in nights** for a booking that starts on (or includes) that day. Common values seen: `3`, `5`, `7`, `255` (encoded "not bookable / no minimum applies because day is `U`").

**Availability rule for a candidate trip with `arrive` → `depart`:**

1. Day `arrive` must have `S ∈ {"A", "I"}`.
2. Every day in `(arrive, depart)` (exclusive on both ends) must have `S == "A"`.
3. Day `depart - 1` (the last night) — covered by rule 2. Day `depart` itself is the checkout day and need not be `A`.
4. `(depart - arrive)` in nights ≥ `M[arrive]`.

If any rule fails, the unit is not bookable for that range.

### 3. Get the full rate quote (HTML)

```
GET https://booksearanchescape.escapia.com/Booking/RateDetails/{pid}?arrive=MM/DD/YYYY&depart=MM/DD/YYYY&adults=N&children=N
```

- HTTP `200` + HTML: parse `<dd class="total-price">$X,XXX.XX</dd>` for the total. The full breakdown (base rent, fees, taxes, promo savings) lives in a `<dl>` immediately above it; the booking summary (check-in, check-out, nights, adults, children, pets) is in the same `<dl>`.
- HTTP `302` → `Location: /Error/UnitUnavailable`: dates are **not** bookable for this unit (despite what the calendar might suggest — Escapia rolls min-stay, blackout, and inventory rules into this single check). Treat this as the canonical "unavailable" signal; it is more authoritative than the `/Unit/Availability/...` JSON alone.

For a robust availability check, hit `/Unit/Availability/...` first to fail-fast on calendar conflicts, then call `/Booking/RateDetails/...` to confirm bookability and read the total price.

### 4. Get rich unit metadata (HTML)

```
GET https://booksearanchescape.escapia.com/Unit/Details/{pid}
```

Stable extractable regions:

- `<title>The Sea Ranch, CA United States - {name} | Sea Ranch Escape</title>`
- `<p id="longDescription">…</p>` — full marketing description (much richer than the catalog `<li>` blurb).
- `<table id="unitAmenities">` — twelve `td.amenity-grouping` / `td` pairs covering **Property Type, Unit Code, Beds, Bathrooms, Rooms, Pets, Living, Kitchen, Entertainment, Outdoor, Geographic, Convenience, Children**.
- Photo carousel: `<img>` tags under `<ul id="thumbnailCarousel1">` with `pictures.escapia.com/SEARES/{pid}/*.jpg`.
- Average ratings: regex `Manager Rating[^(]*\(Based on (\d+) reviews\)` and `Rental Rating[^(]*\(Based on (\d+) reviews\)`.

### 5. Issue the requests via Browserless

Every endpoint above is plain HTTP with no JavaScript dependency. The site sits behind AWS ALB + ASP.NET, not Akamai/Cloudflare/PerimeterX. No CAPTCHA, no rate-limit observed across ~25 requests in iteration; no stealth or residential proxy is required (add `proxy: { proxy: "residential" }` only if the ALB starts refusing datacenter IPs).

Use `browserless_function`: navigate the page to the origin once, then run the GETs as same-origin `fetch`es in-page (a bare cross-origin fetch has no network egress until the page is navigated). Use `redirect: "manual"` so the RateDetails redirect is observable (see gotchas) rather than auto-followed:

```js
// inside browserless_function
export default async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://booksearanchescape.escapia.com/', {
    waitUntil: 'load',
    timeout: 45000,
  });
  const out = await page.evaluate(async () => {
    const r = await fetch('/DesktopDefault.aspx?PageID=11977&page_num=1', {
      redirect: 'manual',
    });
    return { status: r.status, body: await r.text() }; // project/parse in-page for large responses
  });
  return { data: out, type: 'application/json' };
};
```

### Browser fallback

If for some reason the URL endpoints regress (Escapia retires the `/Unit/Availability` JSON route, etc.), drive the form interactively with one `browserless_agent` call (keep all steps in its `commands` array):

1. `{ "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "https://booksearanchescape.escapia.com/", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } }`
2. `{ "method": "type", "params": { "selector": "#ctl03_ctl06_ctl02_arrive", "text": "07/04/2026" } }` and the same for `#ctl03_ctl06_ctl02_depart`.
3. Set `#ctl03_ctl06_ctl02_adults` and `#ctl03_ctl06_ctl02_children` with `type` commands.
4. `{ "method": "click", "params": { "selector": "#ctl03_ctl06_ctl02_submit" } }` — triggers an `__doPostBack` to `DesktopDefault.aspx`.
5. Parse the resulting SearchResults page (same `<ul id="propertyList">` schema as catalog) with a `text`/`evaluate`.
6. **Note:** Even the form-submit path does **not** filter results to _actually available_ units — Escapia's SearchResults module shows all matching catalog units; the only authoritative availability gate is `/Booking/RateDetails/{pid}` returning `200` vs `302`.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **GET-param search filters are cosmetic, not functional.** `/site/SearchResults/default.aspx?arrive=…&depart=…&adults=…&bedrooms=…&pets=…` pre-fills the form widgets but returns the same shuffled catalog page regardless of date/party/bedroom values. We verified: a search for `arrive=01/01/2020&depart=01/03/2020&adults=30` (impossible) still returned 10 listings; a search with `bedrooms=4` returned `[3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 1, 4, 2, 2]` bedroom counts. **Never trust the SearchResults listing as "these units are available for your dates."** Use `/Unit/Availability/{pid}` per unit instead.
- **Catalog ordering is randomized per request.** Two back-to-back fetches of `/site/PropertyList/11977/default.aspx` (or `/DesktopDefault.aspx?PageID=11977&page_num=1`) return different 10-unit subsets — the SortingGuid cookie reshuffles per session. To enumerate the full catalog, walk all 4 `page_num` values; expect overlap. The published total is ~30+ properties but a single 4-page walk may surface ~20-25 unique pids due to shuffle collisions. If completeness matters, repeat the 4-page walk 2-3 times and union the pid sets.
- **`page_num` only works on `/DesktopDefault.aspx?PageID=11977`.** On the dated `/site/SearchResults/default.aspx` path, `?page_num=N` is silently ignored — the pager UI shows "Page 1 of 4" for every request because pagination state lives in `__VIEWSTATE` (POST-only). If you want paginated dated-search results from the browser-fallback path, you must POST with the rotating ViewState — not worth it; just paginate the catalog endpoint and filter availability per-unit.
- **`/Booking/RateDetails/{pid}` redirects on unavailability.** A `302` with `Location: .../Error/UnitUnavailable` is the canonical "no" signal. Fetch it in-page with `redirect: "manual"` — a redirect then surfaces as an `opaqueredirect` response (`status === 0`, `type === "opaqueredirect"`), which is your fail signal; a `200` with a body means bookable. If you instead let a `goto` navigation follow the redirect, you'll land on the error page HTML and have to detect failure by string-match on "UnitUnavailable" — slower and noisier.
- **Date format is US `MM/DD/YYYY`.** ISO 8601 (`2026-12-24`) on the Availability or RateDetails endpoints returns 500 with `parameters dictionary contains a null entry for parameter 'startDate'`. The error page leaks the controller signature (`Escapia.Portal.Controllers.UnitController.Availability(Int32, DateTime, DateTime)`) — useful debug breadcrumb if the path ever changes.
- **`M: 255` in the Availability JSON is a sentinel, not a real min-stay.** It appears on every `U` (unavailable) day and on days that fall outside the bookable window. Treat any `M >= 90` as "ignore min-stay; use the `S` flag alone."
- **`Bedrooms: -` in the catalog `<li>` renders as `0` or an em-dash in metadata.** Some studio/loft units list a dash. Parse defensively: if the bedroom value is non-numeric, fall back to the detail page's `unitAmenities` table where "Property Type" usually includes the property classification ("Studio", "Loft", etc.).
- **All photo URLs are protocol-relative (`//pictures.escapia.com/...`).** Prefix with `https:` before storing or rendering.
- **The portal-alias subdomain matters.** `booksearanchescape.escapia.com` is the canonical host; the parent `www.searanchescape.com` is a separate marketing site that redirects/proxies into the same Escapia portal but with different markup. Always use the `*.escapia.com` host for the endpoints in this skill.
- **Read-only stop point.** The booking flow continues at `/Booking/RateDetails/{pid}` → `/Booking/Details` → `/Booking/Payment`. **Do not POST or click past RateDetails** — that creates a tentative reservation in the manager's system.

## Expected Output

The skill returns one of three shapes depending on input.

### Shape A — Listing query (no dates)

```

### Shape B — Dated availability query

User asked "what's available July 4–7 2026 for 4 adults, dog-friendly?".

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "query": {
    "type": "availability",
    "arrive": "07/04/2026",

    }
  ],
  "candidates_screened": 24,
  "available_count": 1
}
```

### Shape C — No-match outcome

User asked for an impossible/unavailable combination.

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "query": {
    "type": "availability",
    "arrive": "12/24/2026",
    "depart": "12/28/2026",
    "adults": 2,
    "children": 0
  },
  "results": [],
  "candidates_screened": 24,
  "available_count": 0,
  "reason": "all_unavailable",
  "note": "Christmas week — every screened unit returned 302 → /Error/UnitUnavailable from RateDetails, or had U (Unavailable) days in the requested span."
}
```

### Shape D — Unit-detail enrichment (optional)

If the caller requests rich amenities for a returned `pid`, add this object alongside the listing entry:

```json
{
  "pid": "38550",
  "detail": {
    "long_description": "Unit 28 Lot 96 Ocean Front / HIGHLIGHTS: Hot tub with some views, internet access, gas fireplace, gas BBQ, easy walk to Walk On Beach, children welcome. FLOOR PLAN: Open kitchen, dining and living room…",
