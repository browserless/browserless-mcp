# USGS Earthquake Feed

## Purpose

Fetch recent earthquakes from the USGS Earthquake Hazards Program and return them as normalized, structured JSON. Supports four input shapes — a canonical summary-feed URL, a `{magnitude, period}` bucket, an FDSN query (bounding box / radius / time range / magnitude / depth / event-type / alert / review-status), or a single USGS event ID — and emits one row per event with magnitude, place, origin time, lat/lon, depth, intensity, alert level, tsunami flag, significance, status, event type, and the canonical eventpage URL. Read-only.

## When to Use

- Building a real-time / near-real-time earthquake monitor over a region or magnitude threshold.
- Backfilling a historical catalog for a bounding box or epicenter radius.
- Looking up a single event's full detail by USGS event ID (`us7000abcd`, `nc73831706`, etc.).
- Replacing screen-scraping of `earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/map/` — the underlying GeoJSON is the same data the map is rendered from, and it is faster, structurally typed, and free.
- Cross-checking another seismic source (EMSC, JMA, GEOFON) against the canonical USGS reading.

## Workflow

> **Transport note (Browserless):** These are plain HTTPS GeoJSON endpoints — no auth, no anti-bot, permissive CORS (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`) — so the `GET` examples below are canonical and run from any HTTP client. You almost never need a browser here. Only if your caller sits behind restricted network egress, route a request through `browserless_function` (it executes in a browser page context, not Node): `page.goto('https://earthquake.usgs.gov/')` first, then `page.evaluate(async () => fetch('/fdsnws/event/1/query?...').then(r => r.json()))`. Project/trim the response inside the eval (text return is capped ~200k chars).

The USGS Earthquake Hazards Program publishes two stable, public, no-auth HTTP surfaces that return GeoJSON: the **Earthquake Catalog summary feeds** (CDN-cached, fixed pre-built buckets, updated ~1 min) and the **FDSN Event Service** (parameterized query, updated continuously). The web UI at `earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/map/` and the per-event pages at `earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/{id}` are thin clients over these endpoints — **always hit the API directly**. No API key, no cookies, no `Referer`, no User-Agent gating beyond a "please identify your client" courtesy convention. CORS is permissive; no residential proxy needed.

Pick the correct endpoint for the input shape, fetch GeoJSON, then map `features[*].properties` + `features[*].geometry.coordinates` + `features[*].id` to the normalized row schema in **Expected Output**.

### 1. Direct summary-feed URL passthrough

If the caller hands you a URL that already matches `https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/{magnitude}_{period}.geojson`, fetch it as-is. No transformation. Validate that `{magnitude} ∈ {significant, 4.5, 2.5, 1.0, all}` and `{period} ∈ {hour, day, week, month}` before sending — anything else is a 404.

### 2. `{magnitude, period}` bucket → summary feed

Build the URL by template:

```
https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/{magnitude}_{period}.geojson
```

Valid combinations are the **Cartesian product of the two enums**, so there are exactly 20 summary feeds. `significant_hour`, `4.5_day`, `2.5_week`, `1.0_month`, `all_hour`, etc. These are pre-built and CDN-cached; they are the fastest path when the bucket fits.

### 3. Bounding box / radius / arbitrary filter → FDSN Event Service

```
GET https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/query
    ?format=geojson
    &starttime=2026-05-11T00:00:00Z
    &endtime=2026-05-18T00:00:00Z
    &minlatitude=32.0&maxlatitude=42.0
    &minlongitude=-125.0&maxlongitude=-114.0
    &minmagnitude=2.5
    &orderby=time
    &limit=2000
```

Bounding box uses the four `min/max{latitude,longitude}` params; antimeridian-crossing boxes are supported via `minlongitude < -180` or `maxlongitude > 180`. **Radius search** uses `latitude=<lat>&longitude=<lon>&maxradiuskm=<km>` (or `maxradius=<deg>`) with optional `minradiuskm` / `minradius`. Combine with any of the time / magnitude / depth / event-type / alert / review-status / pagination filters listed in **Supported FDSN parameters** below.

The FDSN service caps a single response at **20,000 features**; if the caller's filter could exceed that, set `limit` and paginate with `offset` (1-based, default 1). Use `orderby=time-asc` for forward pagination so newly-arrived events don't shift the offset.

### 4. Single event ID → detail GeoJSON

```
GET https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/query?eventid={id}&format=geojson
```

Returns a **single Feature** (not a FeatureCollection — the `type` is `"Feature"` and there is no `features[]` array). The shape is otherwise identical to a summary-feed feature, **plus** a `properties.products` object containing every contributed scientific product (origin, phase-data, shakemap, dyfi, losspager, focal-mechanism, moment-tensor, finite-fault, …). For the row schema in **Expected Output**, you only need the top-level `properties` + `geometry` + `id`; the `products` block is optional enrichment.

`eventid` is what USGS calls the event's _authoritative_ id (e.g. `us7000abcd`, `nc73831706`, `ci40624479`). Non-authoritative aliases are listed in `properties.ids` (a comma-padded string like `,us7000abcd,at00rxxxxx,`) — any of them will resolve via the same endpoint.

### 5. Map GeoJSON → row schema

For each `feature` (or the single feature in step 4), build a row:

```
event_id       = feature.id
magnitude      = feature.properties.mag                            # number, may be null
mag_type       = feature.properties.magType                        # "Mw" | "Md" | "Ml" | "Mb" | "mww" | "mb" | ...
place          = feature.properties.place                          # "5km W of Volcano, Hawaii"
origin_time    = new Date(feature.properties.time).toISOString()   # epoch ms → ISO 8601 UTC
updated_time   = new Date(feature.properties.updated).toISOString()
latitude       = feature.geometry.coordinates[1]
longitude      = feature.geometry.coordinates[0]
depth_km       = feature.geometry.coordinates[2]                   # km positive down; may be < 0 for shallow
felt_count     = feature.properties.felt                           # DYFI report count, integer | null
cdi            = feature.properties.cdi                            # Community Decimal Intensity 0-10 | null
mmi            = feature.properties.mmi                            # Modified Mercalli Instrumental 0-10 | null
alert_level    = feature.properties.alert                          # "green" | "yellow" | "orange" | "red" | null
tsunami_flag   = feature.properties.tsunami === 1                  # 0 / 1 → boolean
significance   = feature.properties.sig                            # integer 0..1000
status         = feature.properties.status                         # "automatic" | "reviewed"
event_type     = feature.properties.type                           # "earthquake" | "quarry blast" | "explosion" | "ice quake" | "rock burst" | "sonic boom" | "nuclear explosion" | "mine collapse" | "other event"
event_url      = feature.properties.url                            # canonical eventpage URL on earthquake.usgs.gov
```

Coordinate order is **`[lon, lat, depth_km]`** — GeoJSON spec. Swapping lat/lon is the most common bug. Depth is **km positive down**; very shallow events can report negative values (event above the WGS84 reference surface — usually a calibration artifact, occasionally a real shallow explosion).

### Supported FDSN parameters

Pass-through these to `/fdsnws/event/1/query` — document every one in the skill's parameter surface so callers don't reinvent them:

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **GeoJSON coordinate order is `[lon, lat, depth_km]`** — not `[lat, lon]`. Most common bug; latitude is `coordinates[1]`. Depth is `coordinates[2]`, **km positive down**; the very rare negative depth is "above the WGS84 reference" (calibration artifact or shallow explosion), not malformed data — pass it through.
- **`properties.time` and `properties.updated` are epoch milliseconds**, not seconds and not ISO strings. `new Date(p.time)` works directly in JS; in Python use `datetime.fromtimestamp(p.time/1000, tz=timezone.utc)`. Treating it as seconds yields years like 1970.
- **`properties.mag` and `properties.magType` can be `null`** — most commonly on `quarry blast` / `mining explosion` / `nuclear explosion` event types and on extremely new automatic locations where a magnitude solution hasn't been computed yet. Don't assume non-null; emit `null` downstream.
- **`mag` is a single contributor's preferred magnitude** — the FDSN service returns one origin's mag in the summary, but USGS may publish multiple magnitude solutions per event (Mw, Mww, Mb, mb, Ml, Md). For a single event, `&eventid=...&includeallmagnitudes=true` returns the full set under `properties.products["origin"][*].properties` and `properties.products["moment-tensor"][*]`. The summary feeds and bulk FDSN queries only carry the preferred one.
- **`status: "automatic"` events get revised.** Anything in the first 5-15 minutes after origin is `status=automatic` and **the magnitude, depth, and even the location can shift by tens of km / 0.5+ mag units** when a human analyst reviews it (typically minutes to hours later, sometimes a day or two for small events). If you care about ground truth, only emit `status=reviewed` rows, or re-poll with `&updatedafter=<lastSeen>` and re-emit changed events.
- **`type` is not always `earthquake`.** The FDSN catalog also publishes quarry blasts, mine collapses, sonic booms, ice quakes, rock bursts, and nuclear/chemical explosions. The `all_*` summary feeds and unfiltered FDSN queries include them. **If the caller wants only natural earthquakes, send `eventtype=earthquake`** — filtering client-side works too but wastes bandwidth.
- **`significance score (`sig`)** is USGS's PAGER + felt + magnitude heuristic, integer 0..1000. The `significant_*`summary feeds correspond to`sig ≥ 600`. Don't conflate with magnitude.
- **`alert` (PAGER alert level) is rare.** It's only populated for events large enough to trigger a PAGER loss estimate (roughly M5.5+ globally, lower in populated areas). Most events have `alert: null`. The four valid non-null values are `green`, `yellow`, `orange`, `red` (lowercase strings).
- **`tsunami: 1` is a flag, not a forecast.** USGS sets it when the event meets the regional tsunami-warning-center notification criteria (typically M ≥ 7.0 + shallow + offshore). It does **not** mean a tsunami occurred or was forecast. Authoritative tsunami information comes from NOAA/PTWC/NTWC, not this field. Surface the boolean honestly.
- **`felt` (DYFI report count) lags origin by minutes to hours.** Brand-new events almost always show `felt: null` even when they're widely felt; the field populates as users submit "Did You Feel It?" reports. Re-poll the event 1 hr later if `felt_count` matters.
- **`cdi` vs `mmi`** — `cdi` is the _Community Decimal Intensity_ derived from DYFI reports (crowdsourced, lags origin); `mmi` is the _Modified Mercalli Intensity_ derived from ShakeMap instrumental + interpolation (lags ~15-60 min after origin, only computed for events that trigger ShakeMap, roughly M ≥ 3.5 in CA / M ≥ 4.5 globally). Either or both may be `null`; they are not interchangeable.
- **`net` + `code` is a stable composite id**, separate from the authoritative `id`. `id = net + code` in the common case (`us` + `7000abcd` = `us7000abcd`), but events that are reassigned to a different authoritative network keep their old `id` and the new network's code in `properties.ids` (a comma-padded string). The `eventid` query param accepts any id in `properties.ids`.
- **`catalog` vs `contributor` distinction**: `contributor` is the seismic network that _submitted_ an origin solution; `catalog` is the network whose origin USGS chose as authoritative. They are usually equal but can differ — e.g. an event in Northern California where `nc` (Northern California Seismic System) is authoritative may also be contributed by `us` (USGS National Earthquake Information Center). Filtering by `contributor=us` will miss events authoritatively assigned to a regional network. **Prefer `catalog=` for "events authoritatively from this network" and omit both for "all events in the region regardless of who reports them."**
- **`-360 ≤ longitude ≤ 360` for antimeridian-crossing bounding boxes.** A box covering Fiji / New Zealand / the Aleutians needs e.g. `minlongitude=170&maxlongitude=200` (or `-190 to -160`); the service handles the wrap.
- **20,000-feature hard cap per FDSN response.** Anything past that returns an error. Paginate with `limit` + `offset`, and use `orderby=time-asc` (oldest first) for forward incremental polls so newly-arrived events append at the tail rather than shifting all offsets.
- **Summary feeds are CDN-cached ~60s.** A query that just ran one second ago and a query that runs now may return the same response from the CDN. For ≤ 1-minute latency, hit the FDSN service directly with `starttime=<now − N minutes>`.
- **FDSN `time` query precision is seconds (UTC).** Sub-second `starttime` values are silently truncated. Don't rely on millisecond windowing.
- **`includesuperseded=true` returns _every revision_ of every origin/magnitude product**, including ones that were later retracted. Don't enable it unless you specifically want revision history; for current-state queries it inflates the response 3-10×.
- **`jsonerror=true` is opt-in.** Without it, an invalid parameter returns an HTTP 400 with a plain-text or HTML body that's painful to parse programmatically. Always send `jsonerror=true`.
- **No auth, no API key, no rate limit headers** — but be polite: send a meaningful `User-Agent` (e.g. `your-org/1.0 (contact@example.com)`), and don't burst > 5-10 req/s sustained against the FDSN service. The Earthquake Catalog summary feeds are CDN-fronted and tolerate much higher rates because they're static-by-URL.
- **No CORS preflight issues.** `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` on both endpoints; safe to call from a browser-side fetch with no proxy.
- **`detail` URL on summary-feed features points to the per-event GeoJSON** (`…/fdsnws/event/1/query?eventid=<id>&format=geojson`), not to the human-facing event page. The human-facing URL is `properties.url` (`…/earthquakes/eventpage/<id>`). Don't conflate.
- **Event URLs are stable.** `https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/<id>` will redirect to the current authoritative id if `<id>` is a superseded alias.

## Expected Output

Two distinct response shapes — collection (summary feed or FDSN query) and single event.

### Collection response

```json
{
  "source": "summary_feed",
  "feed_id": "significant_week",
  "feed_url": "https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/significant_week.geojson",
  "fetched_at": "2026-05-18T14:32:11.812Z",
  "generated_at": "2026-05-18T14:31:00.000Z",
  "count": 7,
  "events": [
    {
      "event_id": "us7000abcd",
      "magnitude": 5.2,
      "mag_type": "mww",
      "place": "5km W of Volcano, Hawaii",
      "origin_time": "2026-05-18T11:14:32.430Z",
      "updated_time": "2026-05-18T11:48:01.120Z",
      "latitude": 19.4106,
      "longitude": -155.2741,
      "depth_km": 4.8,
      "felt_count": 312,
      "cdi": 5.1,
      "mmi": 4.6,
      "alert_level": "green",
      "tsunami_flag": false,
      "significance": 612,
      "status": "reviewed",
      "event_type": "earthquake",
      "event_url": "https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us7000abcd"
    }
  ]
}
```

For an FDSN query response, `source` is `"fdsn_query"`, `feed_id` is omitted, and the query string is echoed as `query_url`. Add `next_offset` when the response equals `limit` (signals possible pagination).

### Single-event response

```json
{
  "source": "fdsn_event_detail",
  "event_id": "us7000abcd",
  "fetched_at": "2026-05-18T14:32:11.812Z",
  "event": {
    "event_id": "us7000abcd",
    "magnitude": 5.2,
    "mag_type": "mww",
    "place": "5km W of Volcano, Hawaii",
    "origin_time": "2026-05-18T11:14:32.430Z",
    "updated_time": "2026-05-18T11:48:01.120Z",
    "latitude": 19.4106,
    "longitude": -155.2741,
    "depth_km": 4.8,
    "felt_count": 312,
    "cdi": 5.1,
    "mmi": 4.6,
    "alert_level": "green",
    "tsunami_flag": false,
    "significance": 612,
    "status": "reviewed",
    "event_type": "earthquake",
    "event_url": "https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us7000abcd",
    "ids": ["us7000abcd", "at00rxxxxx", "hv73450123"],
    "contributor": "us",
    "catalog": "us",
    "products_available": [
      "origin",
      "phase-data",
      "shakemap",
      "dyfi",
      "losspager",
      "moment-tensor",
      "focal-mechanism"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Error / empty / not-found shapes

```json
// FDSN query with valid params but zero matching events — NOT an error
{ "source": "fdsn_query", "count": 0, "events": [], "query_url": "..." }

// Single-event lookup, id does not exist
{ "source": "fdsn_event_detail", "event_id": "us0000bogus", "error": "event_not_found" }

// Caller-supplied bad combination (e.g. invalid magnitude bucket, mutually exclusive params)
{ "error": "invalid_parameters", "detail": "magnitude must be one of [significant, 4.5, 2.5, 1.0, all]" }

// FDSN service returned a hard error (with jsonerror=true)
{ "error": "fdsn_error", "http_status": 400, "detail": "<usgs error text>" }
```
