# Place a Catering Delivery Order on ezCater

## Purpose

Drive an ezCater catering **delivery** order end-to-end: given a delivery address, date, time, and guest count, search for caterers that can fulfill the slot (respecting each caterer's lead-time/minimum-notice and order-minimum rules), set the delivery date/time and headcount, browse a caterer's menu and size packages/trays to the guest count, add items to the cart with their required options, and proceed toward checkout. The entire cart (address, date/time, headcount, items) is built **anonymously**, but the checkout page itself — event details, delivery instructions (floor/suite/contact), tip, payment, and post-order status — is gated behind an authenticated ezCater account. This skill also covers searching caterers near an address, checking whether a specific date/time slot is available, and the order-status lifecycle (Submitted → Accepted by Restaurant). It is read-only up to the payment step (never submits payment).

## When to Use

- "Find caterers that can deliver to {address} on {date} at {time} for {N} guests."
- "Is {caterer} / are any caterers available for delivery on {date} at {time}?"
- "Build a catering order for {N} people from {caterer} and take it to checkout (but stop before paying)."
- "Size a boxed-lunch / tray order to {N} guests and confirm it clears the order minimum."
- "What's the status of my ezCater order — has the restaurant accepted it yet?"

## Workflow

ezCater is a JavaScript-heavy Next.js app fronted by **Cloudflare WAF**. Drive it with a `browserless_agent` session with **stealth + a residential proxy** — pass `proxy: { proxy: "residential" }` at the top level of the call, and batch the whole flow (search → date/time → headcount → menu → cart → checkout) inside ONE call's `commands` array to save round-trips. The session persists across separate calls, keyed by `proxy`/`profile`, so if you do split across calls, pass the same `proxy` on every one to reconnect to the same session; dropping or changing it lands you in a different, blank session. The homepage loads directly, but the search route throws a Cloudflare "Just a moment…" interstitial that a stealth session clears in ~5 s — always poll the page title/URL after navigating before acting.

There is a useful **URL deep-link** for steps 1–2 that skips homepage interaction; the rest of the flow is necessarily browser-driven.

### Step 1 — Search caterers near a delivery address

Navigate directly to the search route with address query params:

```
https://www.ezcater.com/catering/search/new?city={City}&state={ST}&latitude={lat}&longitude={lng}&street={Street+Address}
```

This 301-redirects to a canonical `https://www.ezcater.com/catering/search/{searchUuid}?...` results page (the `{searchUuid}` is the order/fulfillment id that threads through the rest of the flow). Wait for the title to become `"{City}, {ST} Caterers - Order Online from ezCater"`.

> The proxy's IP geolocates a default address if you omit params (often `Portland, OR` on the usw2 proxy, `Boston, MA` on the homepage). **Always pass explicit `latitude`/`longitude`/`city`/`state`/`street`** to control the delivery location — these override IP geolocation. `latitude`/`longitude` drive distance and which caterers appear.

Results are caterer cards with name, rating, review count, distance, and delivery fee. The header has three filter buttons: the **address** button, the **date/time** button (initially "Anytime"), and **"Event details"** (headcount).

### Step 2 — Set the delivery date and time

Click the date/time button ("Anytime"). A calendar (past days are disabled — earliest selectable is today) plus 15-minute time slots from 10:00 AM appears, with the note _"To ensure on-time delivery and setup, your order may arrive earlier."_ Pick a date button, pick a time button, then click **"Update results"**. The button label updates to e.g. "Tue Jun 30th" and the URL gains `&orderId={searchUuid}`.

**Availability / lead-time semantics:** after setting a date/time, the results list re-filters to only caterers that can fulfill that slot — caterers whose minimum-notice/lead-time or operating hours don't allow it are **dropped from the list**. So "is this slot available for {caterer}?" = "does {caterer} still appear in the results after the date/time is applied?" Past dates and same-day-too-soon times are non-selectable in the picker.

### Step 3 — Set the headcount (Event details)

Click **"Event details"**, fill **"Number of attendees"** (and optional **"Event name"**), click **"Update results"**.

### Step 4 — Open a caterer's menu

Click a caterer card, or deep-link to:

```
https://www.ezcater.com/catering/{caterer-slug}/{YYYY-MM-DD}?fulfillmentDetailId={searchUuid}
```

The menu page shows the delivery summary (address / `Tue 6/30, 12:00 PM` / headcount, each with Edit/Change), the **order minimum** ("Minimum order $50.00 — $50 food & beverage delivery minimum"), the **delivery fee** ("$30.00 & up"), and menu categories. Items are either **per-person** (boxed lunches priced "$16.98 / person") or **trays/group items labeled "Serves N"** (e.g. Serves 10, Serves 12). Some menus show an "Order by {cutoff}" deadline (the caterer's lead-time cutoff for that date).

### Step 5 — Size packages to the guest count

- **Per-person items** (boxed lunches): quantity = guest count (25 guests → 25 boxes).
- **"Serves N" trays/group items**: quantity = `ceil(guests / N)` (25 guests, Serves 10 → 3 trays).
  Mix categories (entrée + sides + drinks) as needed, and ensure the running subtotal clears the **food-&-beverage minimum** (delivery fee does **not** count toward it).

### Step 6 — Add items to the cart (the quantity widget is the tricky part)

Click an item to open its configuration **dialog**. It contains: required modifier radiogroups (e.g. "Select bread", "Select chips" — each defaults to "Most Popular"), optional add-ons, a **"Select quantity" combobox**, an "Add special instructions" field, and an **"Add to Cart $price /person"** button.

> **CRITICAL — the quantity selector is a Radix UI combobox `<button role="combobox">`, NOT a native `<select>`.** A `select` command returns `selected: []` and reading its value returns `""`; clicking it can dismiss the dialog. Drive it by **keyboard**:
>
> 1. Focus the dialog's combobox button — `{ "method": "evaluate", "params": { "content": "document.querySelector('[role=dialog] button[role=combobox]').focus()" } }`, or `click` it precisely.
> 2. Press **Space** (or ArrowDown) to open — this renders ~61 `[role=option]` items in a portal (send the keystroke with the session's key-press command, e.g. `{ "method": "press", "params": { "key": " " } }`; confirm the exact command name via the tool schema).
> 3. **Typeahead the number**: `{ "method": "type", "params": { "text": "25" } }` jumps to "25 boxes", then press Enter (`{ "method": "press", "params": { "key": "Enter" } }`).
> 4. Confirm the trigger text now reads "25 boxes", then `click` **"Add to Cart"** (or **"Update Item"** when editing an existing cart line).

Simple items (chips, bottled drinks, single cookies) have direct **"Add {item} to cart"** buttons that add quantity 1 with no dialog.

### Step 7 — Review the cart and verify the minimum

The right-rail cart lists each line (qty + name + price + size), an editable **Tableware** line ($0.00 — plates/napkins/utensils), subtotal, delivery fee, and **Order total**. If below the minimum it shows **"$50.00 minimum for delivery"** and the **Checkout** button won't proceed. Below the total: _"After checkout, you can make changes until {cutoff}."_ Add or up-size items until the food-&-beverage subtotal clears the minimum.

### Step 8 — Proceed to checkout (stops at the auth wall)

Click **"Checkout"**. If not signed in, ezCater **redirects to** `https://www.ezcater.com/create_account?redirect_url=%2Fcheckout%2F{orderId}`.

> **Confirmed: there is no guest checkout.** Event details, **delivery instructions (floor / suite / dock / on-site contact)**, tip, and **payment** all live on the `/checkout/{orderId}` page, which requires an authenticated account. To continue you must **Sign in** or **Sign up** (First name, Last name, Email, Password [min 8 chars, upper+lower+number+special], Phone). With a valid logged-in session, the redirect lands on `/checkout/{orderId}`, where you fill event details + delivery instructions and stop **before** clicking the final pay/place-order button.

### Step 9 — Read order status after placing

Once an order is placed (post-payment, in the authenticated Orders area / confirmation page), ezCater's lifecycle is: **Submitted** (order sent to the caterer, you can still edit until the change cutoff) → **Accepted by Restaurant** (the caterer confirmed). Surface whichever status the order page shows; "Submitted" means awaiting caterer acceptance.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **Cloudflare WAF is mandatory-stealth.** The homepage 301s and loads, but `/catering/search/...` shows a "Just a moment…" interstitial. A stealth + residential-proxy session clears it in ~5 s — poll the page title/URL (an `evaluate` returning `document.title` / `location.href`) until the title changes before interacting. A bare session (no stealth, no proxy) will stall on the challenge.
- **The quantity selector is a Radix combobox, not a `<select>`.** A `select` command and value read silently fail (`selected: []`, value `""`). There are **zero `<select>` elements** on the item dialog. Open it with **keyboard** (focus button → Space) and pick via **typeahead + Enter**. This is the single biggest automation trap on the site.
- **Clicking the open combobox can close the whole item dialog** (the click lands on the backdrop). Prefer an `evaluate` `.focus()` + keyboard over clicks for the quantity widget; use `click` for normal buttons (Add to Cart, Update Item, Checkout).
- **Address comes from proxy IP geolocation unless you pass explicit params.** Default seen: `Portland, OR` (usw2 proxy). Always pass `latitude`/`longitude`/`city`/`state`/`street` in the search URL — they override IP and drive distance + which caterers appear.
- **The `{searchUuid}` is the spine of the order.** It appears as the search-page path segment, as `orderId=` after applying date/time, and as `fulfillmentDetailId=` on menu URLs. Reuse the same id to keep address/date/time/headcount context across pages.
- **Menu URL embeds the date**: `/catering/{slug}/{YYYY-MM-DD}?fulfillmentDetailId={searchUuid}`. Changing the date changes the path segment.
- **Order minimum vs delivery fee.** The "$50 minimum" is **food & beverage only**; the delivery fee ($30 here) does **not** count toward it. The Checkout button is gated until the food/bev subtotal clears the minimum.
- **Availability = presence in results.** There's no per-caterer "sold out" badge for delivery; a caterer that can't meet the chosen date/time/lead-time is simply **omitted** from the filtered results. The date picker disables impossible dates (all past days; earliest = today).
- **Required modifiers default to "Most Popular."** Boxed lunches force bread + chips selections — they pre-select "Most Popular (…)" so you can add to cart without choosing, but the radiogroups must exist/validate. Note dietary needs in special instructions.
- **Don't waste time looking for guest checkout — confirmed it does not exist.** Checkout always redirects unauthenticated users to `/create_account?redirect_url=/checkout/{orderId}`. The cart-building half is anonymous; the checkout half (event details, delivery floor/suite, payment, status) requires login.
- **Tableware is added free by default** ($0.00, plates/napkins/utensils) and is editable from the cart.
