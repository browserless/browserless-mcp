# Meetup Event Search

## Purpose

Search Meetup for upcoming events matching a topic and location (and any of Meetup's filter dimensions) and return the matching events as structured JSON, plus the region-wide total and a pagination cursor so the caller knows the returned slice is partial. Read-only — never RSVP, join, save, or sign in. The entire first page of results is server-rendered into the `/find/` page's HTML, so no scripted clicking, scrolling, or GraphQL reverse-engineering is needed for the common case.

## When to Use

- "Find AI events in San Francisco", "book clubs in Brooklyn", "climbing meetups near 94110".
- Filtered discovery: a topic category, a date window (today / this weekend / next week), in-person vs online, a distance radius, free vs paid, sort by date/distance.
- Monitoring a city + topic for new upcoming events on a schedule.
- A Meetup search URL (`https://www.meetup.com/find/?...`) you want decoded into structured data.

## Workflow

The optimal path is a single **`browserless_agent` navigation to the `/find/` page through a residential proxy**. The page is a server-rendered Next.js app: the complete `eventSearch` GraphQL connection (results, total count, and pagination cursor) plus every normalized `Event` / `Group` object is embedded in a `<script id="__NEXT_DATA__">` JSON blob _before any JS runs_. Read that blob off the DOM and you have the data — no scripted clicking or GraphQL reverse-engineering for the common case. (Meetup sits behind Cloudflare; a residential proxy is required — a bare request from a datacenter IP risks a 403/challenge.)

1. **Build the search URL.** Base: `https://www.meetup.com/find/?source=EVENTS`. Append the filters the caller asked for (param names below; all are URL query params):

   | Dimension      | Param             | Value                                                                                                                                      |
   | -------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | Topic keywords | `keywords`        | free text, e.g. `AI`, `book club`                                                                                                          |
   | Location       | `location`        | slug form `us--ca--San Francisco` (URL-encoded); free text `San Francisco, CA` also geocodes server-side. For lat/lon use `lat=` + `lon=`. |
   | Category       | `categoryId`      | numeric taxonomy id (see Gotchas table)                                                                                                    |
   | Date window    | `dateRange`       | `today`, `tomorrow`, `this_week`, `this_weekend`, `next_week`; or `customStartDate=` + `customEndDate=` (ISO)                              |
   | Format         | `eventType`       | `inPerson`, `online` (omit for both)                                                                                                       |
   | Distance       | `distance`        | miles from center (e.g. `distance=10`)                                                                                                     |
   | Event type     | `eventType` (fee) | `paid` / free is implicit; price not filterable via URL                                                                                    |
   | Sort           | `sortField`       | `RELEVANCE` (default), `DATETIME` (date), `DISTANCE`                                                                                       |

2. **Navigate through a residential proxy.** Issue a `browserless_agent` call carrying the top-level arg `proxy: { proxy: "residential" }` and a single `{ "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "<url>", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } }` (never `networkidle`). The session persists across calls, keyed by `proxy`/`profile`, so keep the goto and the extract below in the same `commands` array to save round-trips and avoid dropping the session config.

3. **Extract `__NEXT_DATA__` in-page.** Read the blob straight off the DOM with `{ "method": "evaluate", "params": { "content": "(()=>JSON.stringify(JSON.parse(document.querySelector('#__NEXT_DATA__').textContent)))()" } }` — the result comes back under `.value`. Better still, walk to the Apollo store (next step) inside the same `evaluate` and return only the projected fields; the full blob can be large and the text return is ~200k-char capped.

4. **Read the Apollo store.** `props.pageProps.__APOLLO_STATE__` is a normalized cache:
   - `ROOT_QUERY` has a key beginning `eventSearch(...)` → `{ totalCount, pageInfo { hasNextPage, endCursor }, edges[] }`. `totalCount` is the region-wide total; `endCursor` (base64, e.g. `"MTI="` = "12") is the pagination cursor.
   - Each `edges[i].node.__ref` is a string like `"Event:314707414"`. Look that key up in `__APOLLO_STATE__` for the full event.
   - Each Event's `group.__ref` (`"Group:<id>"`) resolves to the hosting group's `name` + `urlname`.
   - `ROOT_QUERY` also carries `locationSearch({"query":"..."})` — the geocoded center (lat/lon/zip/timeZone/name) Meetup resolved the location text to. Use it to confirm the search landed in the right city.

5. **Map each Event** to output (field names as they appear in the Apollo `Event` object):
   - `id`, `title`, `dateTime` (start, ISO 8601 w/ tz), `description` (full body), `eventType` (`PHYSICAL` | `ONLINE` | `HYBRID`), `eventUrl` (canonical).
   - `venue` is **inline** on the Event: `{ name, address, city, state, country }` for in-person; for online events `venue` is null/empty and the platform link lives only on the event detail page.
   - `maxTickets` = capacity; `rsvps.totalCount` = RSVP count; `feeSettings === null` ⇒ free (a non-null `feeSettings` carries the price).
   - `featuredEventPhoto` / `displayPhoto` are `PhotoInfo:<id>` refs (resolve in the store for the image URL); `series` describes recurrence; `socialProofInsights.totalInterestedUsers` is the "interested" count.

6. **Emit JSON** in the Expected Output shape. Mark the slice partial whenever `pageInfo.hasNextPage` is true and surface `endCursor` so the caller can paginate.

### Pagination beyond page 1 (only if needed)

The SSR blob is page 1 (the first ~12 ranked events; the store often pre-hydrates up to ~30). For deeper pages the site's own client POSTs to the persisted-query GraphQL endpoint `https://www.meetup.com/gql2` with `{ operationName, variables: { cursor }, extensions: { persistedQuery: { sha256Hash } } }`. The hash + operation name rotate per front-end deploy and the endpoint is behind `robots: Disallow: /gql*`, so don't hardcode them — for most callers, re-fetching `/find/` with a larger result window or a tightened filter (category/date/distance) is simpler and more durable than chasing the GraphQL cursor.

### Handling a Cloudflare challenge

If the navigation gets challenged or rate-limited, escalate within the same `browserless_agent` call by prepending a `{ "method": "solve", "params": { "type": "cloudflare" } }` command before the `goto`, then read the same blob:

1. `{ "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "<find-url>", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } }` (with `proxy: { proxy: "residential" }` on the call).
2. `{ "method": "text", "params": { "selector": "script#__NEXT_DATA__" } }` or an `evaluate` on that selector — NOT `{ "method": "snapshot" }`; the data lives in a script tag, not the accessibility tree, so snapshot returns nothing useful.
3. Parse `__NEXT_DATA__` exactly as in steps 4–5 above.

Verified working end-to-end (find page returned HTTP 200, full event set extracted) across two iterations.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **Cloudflare — proxy is mandatory, stealth helps.** Meetup fronts everything with Cloudflare. The `/find/` navigation succeeds with a `browserless_agent` residential proxy (`proxy: { proxy: "residential" }`); if it's still challenged, add a `solve { type: "cloudflare" }` command. A datacenter IP risks a `403` / "Just a moment" challenge. In a clean traced run only a single `.woff2` font request 403'd and one telemetry beacon 422'd — the find-page document itself returned **200**, so don't mistake noisy sub-resource failures for a block; check the status of the `/find/?...` document specifically.
- **Read the blob off the live DOM, not a text envelope.** A raw HTTP fetch used to print an `Update available:` banner you had to strip before `JSON.parse`; with a `browserless_agent` you read `document.querySelector('#__NEXT_DATA__').textContent` directly via `evaluate`. Wrap the projection in `JSON.stringify(...)` (the return arrives under `.value`) and project in-page — the text return is ~200k-char capped, so don't ship the whole blob.
- **The data is in a `<script>` tag, not the DOM you'd click.** Read `#__NEXT_DATA__` via an `evaluate` (or `{ "method": "text", "params": { "selector": "script#__NEXT_DATA__" } }`); a `{ "method": "snapshot" }` returns no useful refs for results — the accessibility tree doesn't include script contents.
- **`endCursor` is base64.** `"MTI="` decodes to `"12"` — it's an opaque offset cursor, not the count. `totalCount` is the real region-wide total.
- **`__APOLLO_STATE__` contains more `Event:*` keys than the search returned.** A search for AI in SF yielded `totalCount: 30` but ~54 `Event:` objects in the store — the extras are sparse stubs (`id`, `dateTime`, `group` only) referenced by group cards / series, NOT search hits. **Only treat the refs inside the `eventSearch` connection's `edges[]` as results**; iterating every `Event:*` key pollutes the output with non-matching events.
- **Category taxonomy is a numeric enum** (pass via `categoryId=`). Confirmed from the live front-end bundle:

  | Category                | id  | Category                | id  |
  | ----------------------- | --- | ----------------------- | --- |
  | Technology              | 546 | Music                   | 395 |
  | Career & Business       | 405 | Health & Wellbeing      | 511 |
  | Art & Culture           | 521 | Sports & Fitness        | 482 |
  | Science & Education     | 436 | Social Activities       | 652 |
  | Hobbies & Passions      | 571 | Games                   | 535 |
  | Community & Environment | 604 | Identity & Language     | 622 |
  | Movements & Politics    | 642 | Religion & Spirituality | 593 |
  | Travel & Outdoor        | 684 | Parents & Family        | 673 |
  | Pets & Animals          | 701 | Support & Coaching      | 449 |
  | Dancing                 | 612 | Writing                 | 467 |

  Meetup's live taxonomy is finer-grained than the prompt's 15-bucket list (e.g. "Outdoors & Adventure" maps to **Travel & Outdoor** 684; "Arts & Culture" → **Art & Culture** 521). Verified `categoryId=546` returns Technology events.

- **Location resolution.** `location=` accepts both the slug form (`us--ca--San Francisco`) and free text (`San Francisco, CA`); both geocode server-side, and the resolved center appears under `ROOT_QUERY.locationSearch(...)`. With no location, results geolocate to the proxy/request IP — always pass an explicit `location` (or `lat`/`lon`) for deterministic output. "Online" searches still report a nominal city in the header but the `eventType=online` filter scopes the results.
- **No end time / duration / venue lat-lon in the SSR blob.** The `/find/` query selects `dateTime` (start) but not end time, duration, or venue coordinates. For those, plus online-platform links (Zoom/Meet) and rich group fields (member count, About, founded date), fetch the individual **event page** or **group page** (each has its own richer `__APOLLO_STATE__`). The search-page `Group` object is sparse: `name`, `urlname`, `timezone`, rating stats only.
- **`gql2` is a persisted-query endpoint behind robots.** Don't try to call it with a raw GraphQL query string — it expects an `extensions.persistedQuery.sha256Hash` that rotates per deploy. The SSR blob already contains page 1, so you rarely need it.
- **`robots.txt` disallows the search query params** (`keywords`, `location`, `distance`, `dateRange`, `categoryId`, `sortField`, …) and `/gql*`. This is read-only extraction of public listing data; throttle politely (≤1 req/s) and prefer the single SSR fetch over hammering the GraphQL cursor.
