# Property24 Extract Listings by Neighborhood

## Purpose

Given a Property24 neighborhood (suburb) URL or a `{slug, city, province, suburbId}` quadruple, return every property listing in that neighborhood with structured fields: listing ID, canonical URL, listing type (house / apartment / townhouse / etc.), price (ZAR), bedrooms, bathrooms, parking, floor size, location, listing image, listing date, agent / agency, and (when the per-listing detail page is fetched) full address, lat/lon, erf size, rates & taxes, levies, and amenity flags. Read-only — never submits search alerts, never contacts an agent, never books a viewing.

## When to Use

- Bulk extraction of every for-sale or to-rent listing in a suburb (e.g. "all houses for sale in Rivonia, Sandton").
- Periodic monitoring of new listings posted in a watched suburb.
- Downstream analytics: price-per-square-metre, median asking price by suburb, agent/agency market-share, days-on-market.
- Building a dataset of South African residential property by region — Property24 indexes ~20,750 suburbs nationwide.

## Workflow

Property24 is **server-rendered HTML with no anti-bot wall on listing pages**. The fastest, cheapest, most reliable extraction path is a lightweight `browserless_agent` call that `goto`s the canonical suburb URL and parses the tiles in-page with an `evaluate` — no headed interaction, no captcha. With or without a residential proxy the pages returned 200 OK in testing; a proxy is not required. **Use this lightweight fetch/parse path; the full browser flow is a fallback only.**

### 1. Resolve the suburb URL

Property24 URLs follow a stable pattern:

```
https://www.property24.com/{searchType}/{suburb-slug}/{city-slug}/{province-slug}/{suburbId}
                                                                                      └── numeric, canonical
```

Where:

- `searchType` ∈ `for-sale` | `to-rent`
- `{suburb-slug}/{city-slug}/{province-slug}` is human-readable (`rivonia/sandton/gauteng`, `sea-point/cape-town/western-cape`)
- `{suburbId}` is a numeric ID — **this is the canonical key**. The site 301-redirects any URL with the wrong slug to the correct one as long as the numeric ID is right. Example: `/for-sale/anything/anywhere/anywhere/4251` → 301 → `/for-sale/rivonia/sandton/gauteng/4251`.

To discover the ID + slug for an arbitrary suburb name, GET `https://www.property24.com/sitemap/Suburbs?SearchType=ForSale` — a single XML file (~3.5 MB) listing all ~20,750 suburb URLs. Grep for the suburb name. Cache locally; the sitemap updates daily but suburb IDs are stable across years.

For a province-wide or city-wide search, use the lower-level URL: `/for-sale/{province-slug}/1` (province), `/for-sale/{city-slug}/{province-slug}/{cityId}` (city). The same parsing logic applies.

### 2. Fetch and parse the listing-index page

One `browserless_agent` call navigates to the suburb URL and parses the tiles in-page, so you only ship back a compact JSON projection (never the raw ~220–260 KB of HTML — that risks the ~200k-char result cap):

```json
{
  "commands": [
    {
      "method": "goto",
      "params": {
        "url": "https://www.property24.com/for-sale/rivonia/sandton/gauteng/4251",
        "waitUntil": "load",
        "timeout": 45000
      }
    },
    {
      "method": "evaluate",
      "params": {
        "content": "(()=>{ /* slice tiles + apply the step-3 extractors, return JSON.stringify(listings) */ })()"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The `evaluate` return comes back under `.value`. Each page contains up to ~22 listing tiles (mix of `p24_regularTile` and `p24_proTile` / boosted variants).

### 3. Parse listing tiles from the index page

Tiles are anchored on `<div class="...p24_tileContainer..." data-listing-number="{id}">`. Within each tile:

| Field            | Extractor (regex on the tile chunk)                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `listing_id`     | `data-listing-number="(\d+)"`                                                                                                                                               |
| `url`            | `<a href="(/(?:for-sale\|to-rent)/[^"]+)"` — prepend `https://www.property24.com`, strip the `?plId=…&plt=…&plsIds=…` tracking params                                       |
| `title`          | `<meta itemprop="name" content="([^"]+)"` (e.g. `"5 Bedroom House"`, `"Commercial Property"`)                                                                               |
| `price`          | `<div class="p24_price">\s*([^<]+)` — string `"R 1 421 900"`. Strip non-digits to get ZAR integer. Free-text variants: `"POA"` (price on application), `"Price on Request"` |
| `description`    | `<div class="p24_description">([\s\S]*?)</div>` — strip inner tags; e.g. `"2 Bedroom Apartment in Rivonia"`                                                                 |
| `location_label` | `<span class="p24_location">([^<]+)</span>` (the suburb tag inside the description)                                                                                         |
| `bedrooms`       | `title="Bedrooms"[\s\S]*?<span>(\d+)</span>`                                                                                                                                |
| `bathrooms`      | `title="Bathrooms"[\s\S]*?<span>(\d+)</span>`                                                                                                                               |
| `parking`        | `title="Parking Spaces"[\s\S]*?<span>(\d+)</span>`                                                                                                                          |
| `floor_size`     | `title="Floor Size"[\s\S]*?<span>([^<]+)</span>` — `"69 m²"` (HTML-encoded as `&#xB2;`)                                                                                     |
| `image`          | `<img[^>]+src="(https://images\.prop24\.com/[^"]+)"` — append `/Crop600x400` size suffix variants                                                                           |

To split a page into per-tile chunks: locate all match positions of the regex `<div class="[^"]*p24_tileContainer[^"]*"[^>]*data-listing-number="\d+"` and slice between consecutive matches. Tiles without listing prices use boosted/sponsored layouts — extract title + ID and skip price.

### 4. Paginate

The page footer contains the pagination block:

```html
<a
  href="https://www.property24.com/for-sale/rivonia/sandton/gauteng/4251/p2"
  data-pagenumber="2"
  >2</a
>
```

The maximum page number is the largest integer in `data-pagenumber="(\d+)"`. Construct subsequent URLs by appending `/p2`, `/p3`, etc. to the suburb base URL — **do not** add a query string. Page 1 has no `/p1` suffix (use the bare suburb URL).

Rivonia has 12 pages × ~22 listings ≈ ~260 total. Chaining one `goto` + `evaluate` pair per page inside a **single** `browserless_agent` `commands` array is the convenient default — it saves round-trips. (The session also persists across separate calls keyed by `proxy`/`profile`, so split-across-calls works too as long as you carry the same config each time.)

```json
{
  "commands": [
    {
      "method": "goto",
      "params": {
        "url": "https://www.property24.com/for-sale/rivonia/sandton/gauteng/4251",
        "waitUntil": "load",
        "timeout": 45000
      }
    },
    {
      "method": "evaluate",
      "params": { "content": "(()=>{ /* parse page 1 */ })()" }
    },
    { "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 1000 } },
    {
      "method": "goto",
      "params": {
        "url": "https://www.property24.com/for-sale/rivonia/sandton/gauteng/4251/p2",
        "waitUntil": "load",
        "timeout": 45000
      }
    },
    {
      "method": "evaluate",
      "params": { "content": "(()=>{ /* parse page 2 */ })()" }
    }
  ]
}
```

Be gentle — 1 req/sec is safe; the `waitForTimeout` between pages keeps large crawls under the informal rate limit.

Property24 does not publish an explicit total-results count in the HTML; derive `~total = (max_page × per_page)` where `per_page` ≈ 22 for the first 11 pages and the last page may be partial.

### 5. (Optional) Fetch per-listing detail pages for richer data

Each listing URL (`/{searchType}/{...}/{listing-id}`) returns a detail page with a single `<script type="application/ld+json">` block containing schema.org `RealEstateListing` JSON. The script tag has its `+` HTML-encoded — match `application/ld&#x2B;json`, not `application/ld+json`:

```javascript
const re = /<script type="application\/ld&#x2B;json">([\s\S]*?)<\/script>/g;
```

The JSON-LD provides:

- `datePosted` (ISO date)
- `about.@type` — `Apartment` / `House` / `Townhouse` / etc.
- `about.numberOfBedrooms`, `about.numberOfBathroomsTotal`
- `about.floorSize.value` + `unitCode` (`MTK` = m²)
- `about.address` — `streetAddress`, `addressLocality`, `addressRegion`, `addressCountry`
- `about.latitude`, `about.longitude`
- `about.petsAllowed`
- `offers.priceSpecification.price` + `priceCurrency` (ZAR)
- `offers.offeredBy.name` + `worksFor.name` + `worksFor.url` (agent + agency)
- `description`, `image`, `name`, `url`
- `breadcrumb.itemListElement` — full Province → City → Suburb → Listing path with each level's canonical URL

The detail page also has a Property Overview section accessible via regex:

```javascript
/<div class="col-6 p24_propertyOverviewKey">([^<]+)<\/div>\s*<div class="col-6 p24_propertyOverviewResult">\s*<div class="p24_info">([^<]+)<\/div>/g;
```

Yielding key/value pairs: `Listing Number`, `Type of Property`, `Listing Date`, `Erf Size`, `Floor Size`, `Price per m²`, `Levies`, `No Transfer Duty`, `Rates and Taxes`, `Pets Allowed`, `Bedrooms`, `Bathrooms`, `Kitchens`, `Reception Rooms`, `Parking`, `Pool`, `Security`, `Special Feature`, `Internet Access`, etc. Order and presence vary by listing.

Detail-page fetches are optional — they roughly double extraction cost (1 fetch per listing instead of 1 per index page) but give substantially more depth. Decide based on the caller's needs.

### Browser fallback (only if the lightweight path ever gets blocked)

If the fetch/parse path starts returning 403 / WAF challenges (not observed in current testing, but document the path), escalate to a full `browserless_agent` call and attach a residential proxy. Batching every step in one `commands` array is convenient (fewer round-trips), and if you split across calls, carry the same `proxy`/`profile` each time so you reconnect to the same warmed session:

```json
{
  "proxy": { "proxy": "residential", "proxyCountry": "us" },
  "commands": [
    {
      "method": "goto",
      "params": {
        "url": "https://www.property24.com/for-sale/rivonia/sandton/gauteng/4251",
        "waitUntil": "load",
        "timeout": 45000
      }
    },
    { "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 2000 } },
    {
      "method": "evaluate",
      "params": {
        "content": "(()=>{ /* apply the same step-3 extractors to document.body.innerHTML, return JSON.stringify(listings) */ })()"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

There is no separate session-release step — the session persists across calls keyed by `proxy`/`profile`, so there's nothing to explicitly tear down. A `snapshot` (a11y tree) is not useful for listing extraction here: the listing grid is rendered into nested `<div>` containers without semantic roles, so the accessibility tree is sparse. Parse the HTML in-page with an `evaluate` instead (confirm a selector via `snapshot` only if the regexes ever miss).

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **No anti-bot on listing pages.** Tested with and without a residential proxy; both returned HTTP 200. Stealth is not required. The robots.txt explicitly allows `/for-sale/`, `/to-rent/`, and all suburb / city / province listing pages. **Don't attach a `proxy` unless a 4xx forces you to.**
- **Numeric `suburbId` is canonical; slug is decorative.** Any URL with the right numeric ID at the end and a wrong slug (`/for-sale/anything/anywhere/anywhere/4251`) 301-redirects to the canonical slug. This is robust if you have ID-only references (e.g. from a DB) and don't want to maintain a slug mapping.
- **Pagination uses `/pN` _path suffix_, not query string.** `?page=2` is silently ignored — the page returns page-1 results. Always construct `/{suburb-url}/p2`, `/p3`, etc. Page 1 has no suffix.
- **No total-results count is exposed.** The listing HTML never says `"264 properties for sale"`. Derive it from `max(data-pagenumber)` × per-page (~22). If the caller requires an exact count, fetch the last page and count its tiles, then `(max_page - 1) × 22 + last_page_tile_count`.
- **`<meta itemprop="name">` is not unique per tile.** Some tiles contain a second `<meta itemprop="name">` for the listing agency inside an `Organization` itemscope. Anchor extraction on the FIRST `<meta itemprop="name">` after the tile start, not the last.
- **Two listing-tile layouts coexist on the same page**: `p24_regularTile` (image-on-left, info-on-right) and boosted variants (`p24_proTile`, `p24_boostedTile`). All carry `data-listing-number`, but boosted tiles sometimes omit the `<div class="p24_price">` block (the price is rendered inside a different sub-tree). Tolerate missing price; never reject a tile because price is absent.
- **Price values are space-separated, not comma-separated**: `"R 1 421 900"`, not `"R 1,421,900"`. Strip all non-digits to get the ZAR integer. Special non-numeric values: `"POA"` (Price On Application), `"On Request"`. Treat as `null` numeric + preserve string.
- **Floor size unit is `"m²"` rendered as HTML entity `&#xB2;`.** Decode entity → `²` before storing. JSON-LD reports the same value as `unitCode: "MTK"` (UN/ECE Recommendation 20 — square metre).
- **`{plId, plt, plsIds}` tracking query params on tile URLs.** Always strip — the canonical detail URL is everything before `?`. Two URLs differing only in tracking params are the same listing.
- **JSON-LD `<script>` tag uses `application/ld&#x2B;json` (HTML-encoded `+`).** A naïve regex looking for `application/ld+json` (literal `+`) finds zero blocks. Match `ld&#x2B;json` or use an HTML parser that unescapes attribute values.
- **`/Autocomplete`, `/api/autocomplete`, `/results/GroupedListings`, and `/mapSearch/*` endpoints are 404 or disallowed by robots.txt.** Don't waste time on internal JSON APIs — the public site delivers full data via plain HTML. The sitemap is the supported discovery mechanism.
- **`www.craigslist`-style geo-redirect on bare domain.** `https://www.property24.com/` returns the global homepage (no IP geolocation rewrite). Direct URLs to province / city / suburb pages always honour the slug+ID.
- **Sitemap is the authoritative suburb-name → URL index.** `/sitemap/Suburbs?SearchType=ForSale` lists every suburb URL for sale; the `ToRent` variant lists rentals. Many suburbs appear in both. For finer enumeration there are also per-category variants (`?PropertyCategory=House&SearchType=ForSale` etc.) which let you scope the master list to a single property type — useful when you only care about, say, houses vs. apartments.
- **Rate limit posture is informal.** Property24 does not return `Retry-After` or 429 in fetched traffic; sustained > 5 req/s eventually trips an HTTP 503. Stay ≤ 1 req/s and you're safe across multi-thousand listing crawls.
- **Sandton ≠ Sandton city.** "Sandton" the _city_ has its own URL (`/for-sale/sandton/gauteng/109`), distinct from suburbs _within_ Sandton like `Rivonia` (`/for-sale/rivonia/sandton/gauteng/4251`). The numeric IDs are independent — `109` is the city, `4251` is the suburb. When the caller says "Sandton", clarify which level they mean (or default to the city-level URL and offer to drill into individual suburbs from the breadcrumb).
- **`addressLocality` in JSON-LD = suburb name, not city.** South-African convention: a Rivonia listing has `addressLocality: "Rivonia"`, `addressRegion: "Gauteng"` — Sandton (the parent city) is captured only in the `breadcrumb.itemListElement` chain, not in the postal address.

## Expected Output

Two output shapes — pick based on whether the caller requested detail-page enrichment.

### Shape A — Index-only (fast path, 1 fetch per ~22 listings)

### Edge-case shapes

```json
