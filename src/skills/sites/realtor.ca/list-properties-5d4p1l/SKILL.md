# REALTOR.ca List Properties

## Purpose

Return a list of MLS®-listed properties on REALTOR.ca within a geographic bounding box (or within a named Canadian city), filtered by transaction type (sale or rental), property type group, price range, beds, and baths. For each match, return MLS number, price, address, lat/lon, property type, beds/baths, interior size, listing photo, and the canonical detail URL on `realtor.ca`. Read-only — never contacts an agent, never books a viewing, never modifies favourites or hidden-listing state.

## When to Use

- "What's currently for sale in {city}/{neighbourhood} between $X and $Y with N+ beds?"
- Daily / hourly monitoring of new listings in a target area (sort by date-desc and dedupe by MlsNumber).
- Pulling all rental listings (`TransactionTypeId=3`) in a metro area for market analysis.
- Anywhere you'd otherwise scrape the rendered REALTOR.ca map — the JSON API is one POST per ≤600 results and exposes every field the UI shows (plus several it doesn't, like agent contact metadata and FloorAreaMeasurements).

## Workflow

REALTOR.ca's `/map` and city-listing pages are thin clients over a single POST endpoint at `api2.realtor.ca/Listing.svc/PropertySearch_Post`. The endpoint sits behind Imperva/Incapsula (`reese84`, `incap_ses_*` cookies) so a **bare curl from outside a real browser session always fails** — you need a browser session that has visited `https://www.realtor.ca/` at least once to mint the challenge cookies. Because `browserless_function` executes in a page context, its `fetch()` inherits those warmed cookies; do the warm-up navigation and the API `fetch()` in the SAME call so the Incapsula cookies persist. Once warmed, a page-context `fetch()` to the API returns up to 600 listings as JSON per call, ~90 KB, in 1–2 seconds. Lead with the API; the rendered HTML at `/{province}/{city}/real-estate` works as a fallback but only surfaces ~11 listing cards per page and costs ~3× more turns to harvest the same data.

### 1. Use one `browserless_function` call with a residential proxy

Batching the warm-up navigation, the API `fetch()`, and the parsing inside a **single** `browserless_function` call is the convenient default — it saves round-trips (and the `fetch()` must run in page context after the warm-up navigation regardless). The session itself persists across separate calls, keyed by `proxy`: a later call carrying the **same** `proxy` reconnects to the same warmed browser with the Incapsula cookies intact. Pass a residential proxy at the top level:

```json
{ "proxy": { "proxy": "residential", "proxyCountry": "ca" } }
```

A residential proxy is **mandatory**. Without one, the very first navigation is served Incapsula's "Request unsuccessful" challenge HTML. A Canadian residential IP routes through a Canada-friendly pool; the API itself does not geo-restrict by source IP, so any residential country works if `ca` is unavailable.

### 2. Warm the session (inside the function)

Begin the function body with `await page.goto("https://www.realtor.ca/", { waitUntil: "load", timeout: 45000 })`. A single load of the homepage is enough — it mints `reese84`, `incap_ses_2105_*`, `GUID`, `Language=1`, `Currency=CAD`, `app_mode=1`, and the AppInsights / GA tracking cookies. **Do not skip this step.** The `PropertySearch_Post` endpoint requires the Incapsula challenge tokens to be present on the request.

### 3. Resolve city or area to a lat/lon bounding box

The API only accepts a bounding box (`LatitudeMin`, `LatitudeMax`, `LongitudeMin`, `LongitudeMax`) plus a `ZoomLevel` (1–20, controls clustering / pin granularity). There is no `city=` parameter. Use these stable bboxes for the most-requested Canadian cities (verified 2026-05-19; pick a `ZoomLevel` of 11–13 to get individual pins instead of clusters):

| City                    | LatitudeMin | LatitudeMax | LongitudeMin | LongitudeMax | ZoomLevel |
| ----------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------ | ------------ | --------- |
| Toronto (City of)       | 43.58       | 43.85       | -79.64       | -79.12       | 11        |
| Toronto (downtown core) | 43.63       | 43.68       | -79.43       | -79.35       | 13        |
| Vancouver               | 49.20       | 49.32       | -123.27      | -123.02      | 11        |
| Calgary                 | 50.84       | 51.18       | -114.32      | -113.86      | 11        |
| Ottawa                  | 45.30       | 45.50       | -75.93       | -75.55       | 11        |
| Montreal                | 45.40       | 45.71       | -73.98       | -73.47       | 11        |
| Edmonton                | 53.39       | 53.71       | -113.71      | -113.30      | 11        |
| Hamilton                | 43.20       | 43.30       | -80.00       | -79.75       | 12        |
| Mississauga             | 43.50       | 43.65       | -79.78       | -79.55       | 12        |
| Oakville                | 43.40       | 43.52       | -79.78       | -79.60       | 12        |

For arbitrary cities or neighbourhoods, do not try the `api2.realtor.ca/Search.svc/AutoSuggest` endpoint from page-context — it 0-status fails on CORS because the bundled XHR client adds custom headers that get pre-flighted (see Gotchas). Instead, navigate to `https://www.realtor.ca/{province-code}/{city-slug}/real-estate` (e.g., `/on/toronto/real-estate`, `/bc/vancouver/real-estate`, `/ab/calgary/real-estate`) and read `window.__INITIAL_STATE__` or the active map bounds via:

```js
await page.goto(`https://www.realtor.ca/${PROV}/${CITY}/real-estate`, {
  waitUntil: 'load',
  timeout: 45000,
});
// Then either parse listing cards directly (fallback, ~11 per page) OR
// read the bbox the city page initialises its map with, then POST PropertySearch_Post.
```

Province codes are the standard two-letter ISO 3166-2:CA codes lowercased: `on`, `bc`, `ab`, `qc`, `mb`, `sk`, `ns`, `nb`, `nl`, `pe`, `yt`, `nt`, `nu`. City slugs are the city name lowercased with spaces → hyphens (`new-westminster`, `prince-george`).

### 4. POST PropertySearch_Post from the warmed page context

The whole call is one `browserless_function`: the warm-up `goto` then a same-call `page.evaluate` that POSTs the endpoint (the page context carries the Incapsula challenge cookies the request needs).

```js
export default async function ({ page }) {
  await page.goto('https://www.realtor.ca/', {
    waitUntil: 'load',
    timeout: 45000,
  });
  return await page.evaluate(async () => {
    const params = new URLSearchParams({
      ZoomLevel: '12',
      LatitudeMin: '43.63',
      LatitudeMax: '43.68',
      LongitudeMin: '-79.43',
      LongitudeMax: '-79.35',
      Sort: '6-D', // 6-D = date-desc (newest first); 1-A = price-asc; 1-D = price-desc
      PropertyTypeGroupID: '1', // 1 = Residential; 2 = Commercial
      TransactionTypeId: '2', // 2 = For Sale; 3 = For Rent
      PropertySearchTypeId: '0', // 0 = All residential subtypes
      Currency: 'CAD',
      IncludeHiddenListings: 'false',
      RecordsPerPage: '50', // 1..200 sane; >200 server-caps to RecordsShowing=600 in one shot
      ApplicationId: '1',
      CultureId: '1', // 1 = en-CA; 2 = fr-CA
      Version: '7.0',
      CurrentPage: '1',
      // Optional filters — append only the ones the caller asked for:
      // PriceMin: "500000", PriceMax: "900000",
      // BedRange: "2-0",     // "2-0" = 2+ beds, no upper bound; "2-3" = 2..3 beds
      // BathRange: "2-0",    // same shape as BedRange
      // Keywords: "waterfront pool",
      // OpenHouse: "1",
    });
    const r = await fetch(
      'https://api2.realtor.ca/Listing.svc/PropertySearch_Post',
      {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8',
        },
        body: params.toString(),
      },
    );
    return await r.json();
  });
}
```

Return value comes back under `.value`. For a big bbox this JSON can be large — project each `Results[]` item down (step 5) inside the `evaluate` and return the trimmed array rather than the raw ~90 KB payload.

`PropertySearch_Post` is the **synchronous** endpoint — it blocks until results are ready and returns them in one JSON payload. The site itself uses `AsyncPropertySearch_Post` followed by a long-poll, which is unnecessary overhead for a scripted client. Stick with the sync version.

A 200 OK response has:

```json
{
  "ErrorCode": { "Id": 200, "Description": "Success - OK", ... },
  "Paging": {
    "RecordsPerPage": 50,
    "CurrentPage": 1,
    "TotalRecords": 645,        // total matches in the bbox/filter
    "MaxRecords": 600,          // hard server cap per bbox
    "TotalPages": 13,
    "RecordsShowing": 600,      // == min(TotalRecords, MaxRecords)
    "Pins": 436                 // # of distinct map pins (may be < RecordsShowing if listings cluster)
  },
  "Results": [ /* 1..RecordsPerPage listings */ ],
  "Pins": [ /* map-pin clusters, ignore for listing harvest */ ],
  "GroupingLevel": 4
}
```

### 5. Decode each `Results[]` item

Each item is a fully-named object (no positional-array decoding like Craigslist). Map to a clean shape:

```js
const out = j.Results.map((x) => ({
  mls_number: x.MlsNumber, // e.g. "C13141142"
  realtor_id: x.Id, // realtor.ca internal id, used for /real-estate/{Id}/...
  price: x.Property?.Price, // formatted string, e.g. "$740,000"
  price_value: Number(x.Property?.PriceUnformattedValue), // numeric CAD
  address: x.Property?.Address?.AddressText?.replace('|', ', '), // "1201 - 81 WELLESLEY STREET E, Toronto (Church-Yonge Corridor), Ontario M4Y0C5"
  lat: Number(x.Property?.Address?.Latitude),
  lon: Number(x.Property?.Address?.Longitude),
  postal_code: x.PostalCode,
  province: x.ProvinceName,
  property_type: x.Property?.Type, // "Single Family", "Multi-family", "Vacant Land", ...
  beds: x.Building?.Bedrooms, // "4 + 1" means 4 above-grade + 1 below
  baths_total: x.Building?.BathroomTotal, // includes half-baths
  baths_half: x.Building?.HalfBathTotal,
  size_interior: x.Building?.SizeInterior, // e.g. "232.2557 m2"
  floor_area: x.Building?.FloorAreaMeasurements?.[0]?.Area, // e.g. "2500+ sqft"
  ownership: x.Property?.OwnershipType, // "Freehold", "Condominium", "Leasehold", ...
  parking: x.Property?.Parking?.map((p) => p.Name).join(', '),
  parking_spaces: x.Property?.ParkingSpaceTotal,
  photo_url: x.Property?.Photo?.[0]?.HighResPath,
  remarks: x.PublicRemarks,
  time_on_realtor: x.TimeOnRealtor, // human-readable: "3 min ago", "2 hours ago"
  inserted_date_utc: x.InsertedDateUTC, // .NET ticks (see gotcha below)
  url: 'https://www.realtor.ca' + x.RelativeURLEn,
  agent_name: x.Individual?.[0]?.Name,
  agent_organization: x.Individual?.[0]?.Organization?.Name,
}));
```

### 6. Paginate if `Paging.TotalRecords > RecordsShowing`

The API returns at most `MaxRecords` (currently 600) per bbox regardless of `RecordsPerPage`. To get the rest, **shrink the bbox** (split into quadrants) rather than incrementing `CurrentPage` beyond `ceil(MaxRecords/RecordsPerPage)` — page numbers past that cap return empty `Results`. For dense areas (downtown Toronto pulls 11,902 total in one zoom-11 bbox), recursively split into four sub-bboxes until each is ≤600.

### 7. No session-release step

There's nothing to release — the session persists across calls keyed by `proxy`, so nothing is torn down on return. Batching the warm-up → POST → (optional bbox-subdivision) flow inside ONE call is convenient, but a follow-up call that carries the **same** `proxy` reconnects to the same warmed session with the Incapsula cookies intact — no re-challenge. It's only a call that **drops or changes** the `proxy` that lands in a different, cold session and re-hits the challenge.

### Browser fallback

When the API is blocked (e.g., Incapsula challenge upgrade) or you need to confirm a listing's rendered state, navigate the city URL and scrape the cards. Use `browserless_agent` with the same residential proxy and a `commands` array — a `goto` then an `evaluate`:

```js
// browserless_agent commands: [
//   { "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "https://www.realtor.ca/<PROV>/<CITY>/real-estate", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } },
//   { "method": "evaluate", "params": { "content": <the function below, stringified> } }
// ]
(() =>
  Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('a[href*="/real-estate/"]')).map(
    (a) => ({
      url: a.href,
      mls: (a.textContent.match(/MLS®:\s*(\S+)/) || [])[1],
      price: (a.textContent.match(/\$[\d,]+/) || [])[0],
    }),
  ))();
```

Only ~11 listings per page, JS-driven pagination, expect ~3× more turns and ~10× the cost vs. the API path. Sort defaults to "Recent" (date-desc) and respects `Filters` URL params if you wire them in via the `/map?Filters=...` query string.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **READ-ONLY.** Do not click "Save Listing", "Hide Listing", "Contact REALTOR®", or any heart/favourite icon — those require auth and would touch user state on shared session contexts.
- **Imperva/Incapsula gates everything.** A bare `curl https://api2.realtor.ca/Listing.svc/PropertySearch_Post` from outside a real browser returns the Incapsula challenge HTML (1KB, 200 OK, `<html>Request unsuccessful...</html>`), not JSON. Even from a Browserbase session, you **must** visit `https://www.realtor.ca/` first to mint `reese84` + `incap_ses_*` before the API call. Verified 2026-05-19: the homepage GET issues `reese84=3:...:...` (Imperva sensor data fingerprint) plus 4 distinct `incap_ses_*` cookies tied to the WAF-protected sub-paths.
- **The POST must come from inside the warmed page context.** A bare outside client (or a `fetch` before any navigation) can't reach `PropertySearch_Post` — issue the POST via `page.evaluate` (step 4), in the SAME `browserless_function` call that ran the warm-up `goto`, or the Incapsula cookies won't be attached.
- **`AutoSuggest` and other auxiliary endpoints fail CORS from page-context.** `GET https://api2.realtor.ca/Search.svc/AutoSuggest?text=oakville&CultureId=1&ApplicationId=1` from inside `page.evaluate` returns `status: 0` (CORS pre-flight rejected) even on a warmed session. Stick to `PropertySearch_Post` for the listing API; for city → bbox resolution, navigate to `/{province}/{city}/real-estate` and read map state or use the hardcoded bbox table above.
- **600-record server cap per bbox.** `Paging.MaxRecords` is server-fixed at 600. `Paging.TotalRecords` can be 11,902 (downtown Toronto, zoom 12). To capture all matches, recursively subdivide the bbox until each sub-region's `TotalRecords ≤ 600`. Naively requesting `CurrentPage=7` past the cap returns empty `Results[]`, not an error.
- **`AsyncPropertySearch_Post` is a trap.** The web UI itself uses `AsyncPropertySearch_Post` followed by a poll — that's two round-trips and useless for a scripted client. The synchronous `PropertySearch_Post` returns the same data in one POST. Both endpoints share the same form-body schema.
- **Hash-based map navigation does not refetch.** A `goto` to `https://www.realtor.ca/map#ZoomLevel=12&LatitudeMin=...` updates the URL hash but **the JavaScript does not listen to `hashchange` for filter refetches**. To re-render the map for a new bbox you must either (a) make the API call directly (preferred) or (b) navigate to `https://www.realtor.ca/map?` with the bbox params as query, then wait for `load`.
- **`Bedrooms` is a string and can be `"4 + 1"`.** Above-grade + below-grade splits are encoded as `"N + M"`. Treat it as a string and parse defensively if you need a single integer.
- **`SizeInterior` units are mixed.** Sometimes `"232.2557 m2"`, sometimes `"2500 sqft"`, sometimes empty. The `FloorAreaMeasurements[0].AreaUnformatted` field carries the raw form ("2500-3000 sqft") if you need a range.
- **`Address.AddressText` uses `|` as a separator** between street and city/province/postal: `"3252 LARRY CRESCENT|Oakville (GO Glenorchy), Ontario L6M0S9"`. Split on `|` (max 1 split) to get street vs. locality.
- **`InsertedDateUTC` is .NET ticks** (100-ns intervals since 0001-01-01 UTC), not ISO 8601. Convert: `epochMs = (ticks - 621355968000000000) / 10000`. Most consumers should just use the human-readable `TimeOnRealtor` ("3 min ago", "2 days ago") or `Tags[0].Label`.
- **`/{province}/{city}/real-estate` is SEO-rendered with only 11 listings.** It is NOT the same backend as `/map` — it's a server-rendered SEO page with classic pagination. Map view + API is ~50× faster per record harvested.
- **Currency defaults to CAD.** Pass `Currency=USD` to convert prices in the response — verified the API supports it but does not change the underlying `PriceUnformattedValue` mapping to CAD.
- **`Sort` codes are positional-key:direction.** `1` = price, `6` = inserted date, `21` = floor area. Append `-A` (ascending) or `-D` (descending). `6-D` = newest first; `1-A` = cheapest first.
- **Photo CDN is unauthenticated.** `cdn.realtor.ca/listings/...` images are fetchable without cookies — safe to surface `HighResPath` in your output.
- **`status: 0` from page-context fetch == CORS block, not network failure.** If you see this, the endpoint is preflighted; switch to a different transport (page navigation + DOM read) or skip the endpoint.
- **Cookies survive across calls that carry the same `proxy`.** The session is keyed by `proxy`: a call repeating the same `proxy` reconnects to the same warmed browser with the Incapsula cookies intact and skips the challenge. Only a call that **drops or changes** the `proxy` lands in a different, cold session that re-runs the Incapsula challenge on its first homepage `goto` — budget ~3 seconds extra for that warm-up. This is why the very first call needs the warm-up before the API POST, and why every call should repeat the same `proxy`.
