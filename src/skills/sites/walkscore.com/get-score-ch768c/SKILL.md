# Walk Score Lookup

## Purpose

Given a US/Canadian street address (or any walkscore.com `/score/...` URL), return the **Walk Score (0–100)**, **Transit Score (0–100, when published for the city)**, **Bike Score (0–100, when published)**, the qualitative tier label for each (e.g. `Walker's Paradise`, `Very Walkable`, `Somewhat Walkable`, `Car-Dependent`, `Rider's Paradise`, `Biker's Paradise`), the area / neighborhood label, geocoded latitude/longitude, and the canonical Walk Score URL. Read-only — never submits feedback, edits a place, or signs in.

> **Amenity counts**: The task prompt lists per-category amenity counts (Restaurants, Coffee, Groceries, etc.). These counts are **not** rendered in the initial server HTML — they hydrate from a follow-up `pp.walk.sc` map-marker fetch inside the embedded Google Maps widget. The static HTML only carries the "At this address" featured-place card (a single curated POI). To return per-category counts, fall back to a JS-rendered fetch (browser path below). Default-emit `null` for unavailable counts and document this in the output.

## When to Use

- A user asks "how walkable is {address}?"
- Real-estate / rental agents comparing walkability across listings.
- Pre-filling a relocation worksheet (commute mode mix, transit, bike).
- Bulk scoring of a list of addresses (the API path costs ~0.8–1.3s/request and tolerates ≥1 req/s).

## Workflow

The walkscore.com consumer detail page is **fully server-rendered for the score numbers, tier labels, lat/lon, and area label** — every value the task asks for is in the initial HTML. **Lead with a single `browserless_agent` `goto` to `https://www.walkscore.com/score/{slug}`** (a real browser follows the 301 to the canonical slug automatically), then read the final page's HTML and run the documented regex extraction in-page. Do not wait on JS hydration unless you specifically need amenity-by-category counts (see "Browser fallback" below — they require the embedded Google Maps marker layer to load).

### 1. Construct the score URL from the user-supplied address

The site accepts `+` or `%20` for spaces and normalizes free-form addresses via a 301 redirect to the canonical hyphenated slug. **You do not need to reproduce the homepage's `encodeAddress()` function** — just URL-encode the user input.

```bash
ADDR="1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, DC 20500"
SLUG=$(python3 -c 'import urllib.parse,sys; print(urllib.parse.quote_plus(sys.argv[1]))' "$ADDR")
URL="https://www.walkscore.com/score/${SLUG}"
```

(Canadian addresses follow the same form but must end in `…-bc-canada`, `…-on-canada`, etc. The server's 301 handler fills the `-canada` suffix in for you — see Gotchas.)

### 2. Navigate to the score URL (preferred — no proxy, no JS-hydration wait)

```json
{
  "method": "goto",
  "params": {
    "url": "https://www.walkscore.com/score/1600-pennsylvania-ave-nw-washington-dc-20500",
    "waitUntil": "load",
    "timeout": 45000
  }
}
```

No proxy needed — the site is only lightly bot-walled (none observed in 4-iter testing; three sequential bare requests all returned 200 in <1.3s). Add `proxy: { proxy: "residential" }` to the call only if you hit a 403/Akamai-style block.

### 3. The 301 redirect is followed automatically

A real browser follows the server's 301 to the canonical slug for you, so after `goto` you are already on the final canonical page — no manual `Location`-header re-fetch step. (The underlying fact still matters: you must read the **final** canonical page, not a "Redirecting..." stub — the browser lands you there.)

The server applies redirects for: spaces → hyphens, "Avenue" → "ave", "Fifth" → "5th", "Street" → "st", missing zip → nearest canonical with zip, BC-only → BC-Canada, and approximate fuzzy matches (e.g. `4-private-rd-jackson-wy-83001` 301s to `125-e-pearl-ave-jackson-wy-83001`). Read the badges/labels from the landed page. The redirect chain is at most one hop in observed cases.

### 4. Extract from the canonical 200 response

All five required values come from straightforward regex / DOM scans on the HTML:

| Field                                         | Pattern                                                                                                                                     |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `walk_score`                                  | Integer in `<img src="//pp.walk.sc/badge/walk/score/{N}.svg">`                                                                              |
| `transit_score`                               | Integer in `//pp.walk.sc/badge/transit/score/{N}.svg` (absent → `null`, see gotcha)                                                         |
| `bike_score`                                  | Integer in `//pp.walk.sc/badge/bike/score/{N}.svg` (absent → `null`)                                                                        |
| `walk_label` / `transit_label` / `bike_label` | First `<h5 class='tight-bot'>{LABEL}</h5>` appearing after each badge img. Decode `&rsquo;` → `'`.                                          |
| `lat` / `lng`                                 | `data-lat="{N}" data-lng="{N}"` on the `.commute-summary` element. Stable single occurrence per page.                                       |
| `area_label` (neighborhood + city)            | `data-label="{LABEL}"` on the same `.commute-summary` element (e.g. `Downtown Washington, DC`, `Downtown Manhattan`, `Downtown Vancouver`). |
| `address`                                     | `<title>{ADDRESS} - Walk Score</title>` — already normalized to the canonical form ("Avenue Northwest" not "Ave NW").                       |
| `canonical_url`                               | `<link rel="canonical" href="{PATH}">` (note: site emits a path, not absolute URL — prepend `https://www.walkscore.com`).                   |

Run the extractor in-page with an `evaluate` command — read the landed page's own HTML off `document`, apply the same regexes, and return a compact JSON projection:

```json
{
  "method": "evaluate",
  "params": {
    "content": "(() => { /* extractor below, returns JSON.stringify(out) */ })()"
  }
}
```

Extractor body (no DOM lib needed — `html` is `document.documentElement.outerHTML`):

```js
const html = document.documentElement.outerHTML;
const num = (type) =>
  parseInt((html.match(new RegExp(`badge/${type}/score/(\\d+)`)) || [])[1]) ||
  null;
const tierFor = (type) => {
  const idx = html.indexOf(`badge/${type}/score/`);
  if (idx < 0) return null;
  const m = html
    .slice(idx, idx + 2000)
    .match(/<h5\s+class=['"]tight-bot['"]>([^<]+)<\/h5>/);
  return m ? m[1].replace(/&rsquo;/g, "'") : null;
};
const out = {
  walk_score: num('walk'),
  transit_score: num('transit'),
  bike_score: num('bike'),
  walk_label: tierFor('walk'),
  transit_label: tierFor('transit'),
  bike_label: tierFor('bike'),
  lat: parseFloat((html.match(/data-lat="([^"]+)"/) || [])[1]) || null,
  lng: parseFloat((html.match(/data-lng="([^"]+)"/) || [])[1]) || null,
  area_label:
    (html.match(/data-label="([^"]+)"\s+class=['"]commute-summary/) || [])[1] ||
    null,
  address:
    (html.match(/<title>([^<]+)\s*-\s*Walk Score<\/title>/) || [])[1] || null,
  canonical_url:
    'https://www.walkscore.com' +
    ((html.match(/<link[^>]+rel=["']canonical["'][^>]+href=["']([^"']+)/) ||
      [])[1] || ''),
};
return JSON.stringify(out);
```

### 5. Branch on the landed page

- **Populated badges** → success, return scores. If `transit_score` or `bike_score` is `null`, that city simply doesn't have Walk Score's Transit / Bike Score published — return `null` for both score and label (not zero).
- **404 page** → emit `{ success: false, error_reasoning: "address_not_found" }`. The 404 page title is `404 Page Not Found - Walk Score` (the `goto` lands on it directly).
- **Missing badges on a 200 page** → only seen when the URL is the lat/lng metro-centroid form (`/score/loc/lat=X/lng=Y`); treat as `success: false, error_reasoning: "address_not_geocoded"`.

### Browser fallback (only when amenity-by-category counts are required)

The amenity counts (Restaurants, Coffee, Groceries, Shopping, Errands, Parks, Schools, Entertainment) come from the Google Maps marker layer that hydrates after `initialize()` runs. To capture them:

Run these as the `commands` array of one `browserless_agent` call — the `waitForTimeout` lets the markers hydrate, then `evaluate` reads the counts in-page:

```json
{ "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "https://www.walkscore.com/score/1600-pennsylvania-ave-nw-washington-dc-20500", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } },
{ "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 3000 } },
{ "method": "evaluate", "params": { "content": "(function(){\n  // Sidebar nav exposes category counts as <a class=\"tab\" data-type=\"X\"><span class=\"count\">N</span></a>\n  const out = {};\n  document.querySelectorAll(\".sidebar-nav a.tab, .ws-amenities-tabs li\").forEach(el => {\n    const t = el.getAttribute(\"data-type\") || el.querySelector(\".label\")?.textContent?.trim();\n    const c = el.querySelector(\".count\")?.textContent?.trim();\n    if (t && c) out[t] = parseInt(c) || 0;\n  });\n  return JSON.stringify(out);\n})()" } }
```

Markers hydrate ~2–3s after load. The exact selectors for the amenity tab list can drift; verify against a `snapshot` first. **Do not click amenity tabs / map markers / "Get a quote" buttons** — read-only is the rule.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **You must read the FINAL canonical page, not the 301 stub.** A real browser (`browserless_agent` `goto`) follows the redirect for you and lands on the canonical page, so this is handled automatically — but if you ever fetch with a raw HTTP client that does not auto-follow, the 301 body is a tiny "Redirecting..." stub with no badges and extraction returns all-nulls. Either way, extract only from the canonical page's body.
- **Transit / Bike score absence is a real outcome, not an error.** Cities without Walk Score's transit data (Jackson WY, most exurbs, many small Canadian cities) simply omit the `badge/transit/score/{N}` markup. Emit `null` for both the score and label — do not default to 0.
- **Tier labels use HTML entities.** `Rider's Paradise` ships as `Rider&rsquo;s Paradise` (likewise `Biker&rsquo;s Paradise`, `Walker&rsquo;s Paradise`). Decode `&rsquo;` → `'` before returning. The five Walk Score tiers are `Walker's Paradise` (90–100), `Very Walkable` (70–89), `Somewhat Walkable` (50–69), `Car-Dependent` (25–49), `Car-Dependent` again at lower scores ("Almost all errands require a car"). Transit tiers: `Rider's Paradise` (90+), `Excellent Transit` (70–89), `Good Transit` (50–69), `Some Transit` (25–49), `Minimal Transit` (<25). Bike tiers: `Biker's Paradise` (90+), `Very Bikeable` (70–89), `Bikeable` (50–69), `Somewhat Bikeable` (<50). Emit the literal label from the page rather than re-deriving from the integer — the boundaries shift occasionally and the page is authoritative.
- **Canadian addresses need `-canada` in the slug**, but the 301 handler will add it for you. `https://www.walkscore.com/score/200-burrard-st-vancouver-bc` → 301 → `…-vancouver-bc-canada`. Don't bother detecting Canadian addresses client-side; just submit the raw form and follow.
- **Server fuzzy-matches addresses very aggressively.** `4-private-rd-jackson-wy-83001` (a nonsense rural address) 301s to `125-e-pearl-ave-jackson-wy-83001` (the nearest known address). Returned scores reflect the **redirected** address, not the original input. **Always emit the canonical_url and the extracted `<title>` address so callers can detect when the lookup snapped to a different point.** If `address` differs meaningfully from the user's input, flag it.
- **`/score/loc/lat=X/lng=Y` is NOT a per-address lookup.** It returns the score for the **metro centroid** nearest those coordinates, not the building at that point. E.g. `lat=40.7580/lng=-73.9855` (real Times Square) returns the generic "Manhattan NY" page with `data-lat=40.7208, data-lng=-74.0006` (Tribeca) and metro-default scores 100/100/92. Use this URL form only for "what's it like in {neighborhood}?" queries — never for street-address lookups. Prefer the slug path.
- **`<title>` city is double-printed.** Observed: `"1600 Pennsylvania Avenue Northwest, Washington, DC DC - Walk Score"` — the state abbreviation appears twice. This is a Walk Score template bug; if you parse city/state from the title, dedupe the trailing token.
- **`encodeAddress()` is defined inline on the homepage** in a `onsubmit` handler that we did not need to reproduce — URL-encoding the raw user input plus a 301 follow is functionally equivalent and avoids depending on the homepage JS surviving.
- **Lat/lng on the page is the geocoded centroid of the addressed property**, not a commute target. The `.commute-summary` element happens to live in the commute widget but its `data-lat`/`data-lng` is the address point. Stable single occurrence per page (one address = one geocode).
- **Amenity counts are not in the static HTML.** The static page only carries one "At this address" featured place (curated POI like "White House Rose Garden"). The Restaurants / Coffee / Groceries / Shopping / Errands / Parks / Schools / Entertainment counts come from the Google Maps marker layer (`maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?...&libraries=places&callback=initialize`) populated after a follow-up XHR to `walkscore.com` — if your task needs them, take the browser-fallback path.
- **No formal rate limit observed.** Three sequential bare-IP requests for the same score page returned 200 in 0.7–1.3s each with no captcha. The site's robots.txt and 60-second `Cache-Control: public, max-age=60` header suggest sustained ≥1 req/s is fine, but pace politely (the SKILL spec says "lookups should pace politely"). For bulk runs >100 addresses, add a 0.5s jitter and add `proxy: { proxy: "residential" }` to the call to avoid surface contention.
- **No bot wall for read-only score pages.** Navigating to `/score/...` works with a plain `browserless_agent` call — no proxy or stealth arg. Reserve the residential `proxy` for the browser-fallback path if you hit interactive Akamai.
- **Two distinct `&copy;` notices** in the footer reference Walk Score data and the Google Maps imagery — `Walk Score &copy; 2026` is the dynamic year; don't use it as a freshness signal.
- **Do NOT use this skill to submit feedback, edit places, or click the "Get a quote" / "Apartments for rent" leadgen widgets.** Those break the read-only contract and trigger downstream affiliate analytics.
