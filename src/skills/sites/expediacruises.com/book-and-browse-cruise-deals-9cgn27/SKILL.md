      The /en-us/corporate/Deals page and all corporate marketing pages are

      The cruise search engine and package/booking pages
      (bookus.expediacruises.com/swift/*) are an Odysseus 'swift-v2-prod' SPA:
      JS-rendered and gated by reCaptcha/Cloudflare Turnstile + 429

      per-cabin pricing reliably; the underlying AJAX API is not directly
      callable.

      Not viable — the swift search/booking data endpoints sit behind captcha

# Expedia Cruises Deals & Cruise Search

## Purpose

This skill operates on Expedia Cruises (expediacruises.com) to do three related, **read-only** things: (1) pull the current "Deals of the Week" offers, (2) search live cruise sailings by destination, cruise line, ship, dates, or duration, and (3) open a specific cruise's per-cabin pricing and the start of its booking flow. It returns structured data — deal cards, sailing-search result rows, and itinerary/pricing detail — and **stops before any payment or booking submission**. Expedia Cruises is a franchise travel-agency network, so the consumer-facing site is split between a server-rendered corporate marketing site (`www.expediacruises.com/en-us/corporate/...`) and a separate JS booking engine (`bookus.expediacruises.com/swift/...`); this skill uses the cheapest reliable method for each half.

## When to Use

- "What cruise deals does Expedia Cruises have this week?" — extract the Deals-of-the-Week cards (itinerary, line, ship, dates, starting price).
- "Find me cruises to the Caribbean / on Royal Caribbean / on a specific ship, cheapest first" — run the sailing search and read result rows with per-cabin prices.
- "How much is cruise X / what does the booking flow look like?" — open a package/itinerary page for per-person pricing (Inside/Outside/Balcony/Suite) and bonus offers.
- "Get me a quote for this cruise" — surface the Request-a-Quote link (routes to a human travel agent, no payment).
- NOT for: completing a purchase, entering guest/passenger details, or submitting payment. Stop at the pricing/availability screen.

## Workflow

There are two surfaces. **Deals and all corporate pages are server-rendered — read them with a lightweight `goto` + `evaluate`. The cruise search + booking pages are a captcha-gated SPA — drive them in a real browser.** Use a `browserless_agent` session with stealth + a residential proxy for the browser half (the corporate site is behind Akamai and the booking engine behind reCaptcha/Turnstile + a 429 rate limiter).

### A. Pull the deals (server-rendered — fastest, no JS, no captcha)

1. Load the deals page directly — do **not** start at the bare domain (it redirect-chains through three hostnames; see Gotchas). Use a `browserless_agent` `goto` on a residential proxy, then parse the server-rendered HTML in-page:
   ```json
   {
     "proxy": { "proxy": "residential" },
     "commands": [
       {
         "method": "goto",
         "params": {
           "url": "https://www.expediacruises.com/en-us/corporate/Deals",
           "waitUntil": "load",
           "timeout": 45000
         }
       },
       {
         "method": "evaluate",
         "params": {
           "content": "(()=>{ /* walk each Deals-of-the-Week card, return a compact JSON array */ })()"
         }
       }
     ]
   }
   ```
   Returns HTTP 200, ~520 KB of fully-rendered HTML — project the deal cards in-page rather than shipping the raw document.
2. Parse each "Deals of the Week" card. Per card you get: itinerary title (e.g. `5 Night Caribbean Western Cruise`), ports (Tampa → Costa Maya → Cozumel → Tampa), cruise line + ship, departure & return dates, the "from" price with `Taxes & fees included`, a promotion ID, and two links:
   - `Learn More` → `https://bookus.expediacruises.com/swift/cruise/package/{packageId}?siid=1095905&lang=1`
   - `Request a Quote` → `/en-us/corporate/RequestAQuote?cruise={packageId}&refPage=Deals`
3. Regional/category deal subpages exist and fetch the same way, e.g. `/en-us/corporate/Deals/Europe`, `/en-us/corporate/Deals/group-travel`, `/en-us/corporate/Deals/guided-tours`.

### B. Search live sailings (browser — the swift SPA)

1. Open the search engine with query params (it deep-links straight to a populated result set) in a proxied `browserless_agent` session:
   ```json
   {
     "proxy": { "proxy": "residential" },
     "commands": [
       {
         "method": "goto",
         "params": {
           "url": "https://bookus.expediacruises.com/swift/cruise?siid=1095905&lang=1&destinationType=All&sortColumn=price&sortOrder=asc",
           "waitUntil": "load",
           "timeout": 45000
         }
       },
       { "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 8000 } }
     ]
   }
   ```
   (The SPA renders + populates result rows during the wait.)
2. Read the `N Sailings Found` count (e.g. "63,724 Sailings Found") and scroll to the result rows. Each sailing row shows a sail date, four per-cabin price columns (Inside / Outside / Balcony / Suite), `Includes taxes and fees`, and a BOOK button. Extract with an `evaluate` projection (or a `snapshot` of the a11y tree).
3. Narrow with URL params instead of clicking the form when possible — they are the reliable fast path:
   - `&cruiseline={cruiselineId}` — filter to one line (e.g. `&cruiseline=982`)
   - `&ship={shipId}` — filter to one ship (e.g. `&ship=15127`)
   - `&destinationType=All` plus `&sortColumn=price&sortOrder=asc` — cheapest first
   - The on-page form also exposes Going to / Sailing Dates / Duration / Cruise Line / Ship / Departure Port and a left-rail filter panel (Cabin Type, Cruise Line, Price Per Person, ports).

### C. Open a cruise's pricing + booking flow (browser, READ-ONLY)

1. Open the package/itinerary page (the `packageId` comes from a deal card or a search result), in the same proxied session:
   ```json
   { "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "https://bookus.expediacruises.com/swift/cruise/package/1484845?siid=1095905&lang=1", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } },
   { "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 8000 } }
   ```
2. Read `Price Per Person From` for each cabin tier (Inside / Outside / Balcony / Suite), the per-person "from … /mo" financing line, itinerary (ports + day-by-day dates), and `Available Bonus Offers`. The page header is a four-step booking breadcrumb: **Guest Information → Category → Staterooms → Check out**.
3. **STOP HERE.** Do not click BOOK, advance the breadcrumb, enter guest/passenger details, or submit payment. To hand off to a human, return the Request-a-Quote URL from step A.2 instead.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **Never start at the bare domain.** `https://expediacruises.com/` → 301 → `https://www.expediacruise.com/en-US` (note: singular `expediacruise.com`) → 301 → `https://www.expediacruises.com/en-us/` → 302 → `/en-us/corporate`. Always request `https://www.expediacruises.com/en-us/corporate/...` paths directly to skip the chain. URL path casing matters in the redirects (`/en-US` vs `/en-us`).
- **Two completely different stacks.** Marketing/deals = `www.expediacruises.com/en-us/corporate/*`, server-rendered HTML behind **AkamaiGHost** (`X-Akamai-Reference-Id` header). Search/booking = `bookus.expediacruises.com/swift/*`, an **Odysseus "swift-v2-prod" SPA** served off `contents.odysol.com`. Don't expect deal data on bookus, or live availability on the corporate site.
- **The swift search API is captcha-gated — don't try to call it directly.** The SPA loads `recaptcha/api.js` and Cloudflare Turnstile (`challenges.cloudflare.com/turnstile`), and the page config carries explicit rate-limit error strings (`rateLimitExceededErrorMessage`, "Please wait a minute and try again (429)"). Direct AJAX/JSON requests are rate-limited and security-keyed. Use a real stealth browser session; budget an 8s render wait and don't hammer reloads.
- **`siid=1095905` is the franchise site id** baked into every booking-engine link (`siteItemId` in the page config). Reuse the `siid` you find on the deals page rather than inventing one; a wrong/empty `siid` can break the search form's security key (error code `429-CSKInvalid`).
- **Prices lazy-load.** Deal-card "from" prices are in the server HTML, but inside the swift SPA the per-cabin price columns populate a beat after the result rows; wait for `$` amounts to appear before extracting, otherwise you'll capture night counts with empty prices.
- **`destinationType=All` returns the full inventory** (~63k sailings) — always pair it with a real filter (`cruiseline`, `ship`, dates, or destination) or at least `sortColumn=price&sortOrder=asc` so the first rows are meaningful.
- **Read-only boundary:** the package page's `BOOK` buttons and the `Guest Information → … → Check out` breadcrumb lead into a real reservation. Never proceed. The `RequestAQuote` link is the safe human-handoff.
- **Anti-bot reality vs. the pre-run probe.** The host probe reported "none detected / likelyNeedsVerified:false," but the corporate site is fronted by Akamai and the booking engine by reCaptcha+Turnstile. The successful run used a stealth session on a residential proxy; keep stealth on. No block was hit during testing, but a bare session is not advised.
- **No autoa network trace/strategy shipped with this skill:** the build sandbox lacked a real Anthropic credential (`ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` was the literal string `placeholder`), so the inner self-improvement agent couldn't run. All findings here come from direct browser automation plus server-rendered HTML extraction, which worked normally.
