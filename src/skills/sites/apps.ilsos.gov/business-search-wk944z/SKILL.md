# Illinois SOS Business Entity Search

## Purpose

Search the Illinois Secretary of State **Business Entity Search** (`apps.ilsos.gov/businessentitysearch/`) by business name and return the matching entities (file number, entity name, and status). Read-only — never initiates certificate purchases or order flows.

**Status: CANDIDATE / partially blocked.** The search **input form** (a GET page) loads reliably, but the **search submission itself** (a POST to `/businessentitysearch/businessentitysearch`) is gated by **Akamai Bot Manager** and was _not_ reliably passable from an automated stealth session during testing (5 attempts, stealth + residential proxy). The form mechanics below are fully characterized so a future agent on a trusted IP, or one with a working CAPTCHA-solving path, can complete the extraction.

## When to Use

- Look up an Illinois corporation / LLC / LP / LLP / not-for-profit by business name.
- Confirm whether a business name is registered in Illinois and retrieve its file number and status.
- Any flow that would otherwise scrape the IL SOS business registry. (Note the database's own terms forbid bulk/automated extraction — this skill is for individual lookups only.)

## Workflow

`recommended_method: browser`. There is **no public API or GET shortcut** — the search endpoint only accepts the POST form, and the same Akamai gate applies to it (a GET to the action URL is also rejected). Drive it with a single `browserless_agent` call carrying a residential `proxy` (`proxy: { proxy: "residential" }`) — a residential proxy produced the softer, occasionally-recoverable reCAPTCHA path; a stealth-only/no-proxy run got a harder `ERR_HTTP2_PROTOCOL_ERROR` connection reset. Keep the whole warm-up → fill → submit flow in the one call's `commands` array so the Akamai sensor cookies (`/akam/13/…`, `/JI_uid/…`) persist across the steps; batching also avoids dropping the session config (the session persists across calls, keyed by `proxy`).

1. **One call, residential proxy.** No separate session create/release — issue everything as one `browserless_agent` call with `proxy: { proxy: "residential" }`. The session persists across calls keyed by that `proxy`; a fresh call with the same `proxy` reconnects to it, while dropping or changing it lands you in a different, blank session.
2. **Open the form** (this GET page is _not_ challenged):
   ```json
   { "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "https://apps.ilsos.gov/businessentitysearch/", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } },
   { "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 5000 } }
   ```
   The wait lets the Akamai sensor (`/akam/13/…`, `/JI_uid/…`) mature.
3. **Resolve the controls.** Prefer the stable CSS selectors below (accessibility refs from `snapshot` are not stable across snapshots — don't hardcode them; a fresh `snapshot` only confirms a selector if one misses):
   - `radio` **Business Name** — the default search method: `input[name='searchMethod'][value='s']`
   - `textbox` **Start a New Search** — `#searchValue` (name=`searchValue`, maxlength 30)
   - `button` **Submit** — `#btnSearch`
4. **Select method + enter the query + submit:**
   ```json
   { "method": "click", "params": { "selector": "input[name='searchMethod'][value='s']" } },
   { "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 1500 } },
   { "method": "type", "params": { "selector": "#searchValue", "text": "smith ventures" } },
   { "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 1500 } },
   { "method": "click", "params": { "selector": "#btnSearch" } },
   { "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 4000 } }
   ```
   Use a real `click` on `#btnSearch` (not a JS `.click()` — see Gotchas).
5. **Detect the Akamai gate.** Read the title/URL with an `evaluate` (`(()=>({title:document.title,url:location.href}))()`):
   - `title == "Challenge Validation"` (body: _"Please solve this quick test to confirm you are a person, not a robot"_, an image grid like "Select all squares with crosswalks") → reCAPTCHA wall.
   - `url == "chrome-error://chromewebdata/"` with title `apps.ilsos.gov` and body `ERR_HTTP2_PROTOCOL_ERROR` → connection-reset wall.
   - Title `Business Entity Search` (results page reuses this title) with a results table in the body → **success**.
6. **If gated:** attempt the `solve` command for the reCAPTCHA image challenge (`{ "method": "solve", "params": { "type": "recaptcha" } }`), then re-check the title/URL. In testing this did **not** reliably clear the Akamai-served image challenge — do not hand-click tiles, and if `solve` returns without clearing the gate, emit `success: false` with the challenge text. The `ERR_HTTP2_PROTOCOL_ERROR` reset is terminal (no captcha to solve) — report it as blocked.
7. **If a results page renders:** extract with an `evaluate` that walks the results table (or `{ "method": "text", "params": { "selector": "body" } }`). Each result row carries a **File Number**, **Entity Name**, and **Status** (Active / Dissolved / etc.). Capture every row. Zero matches → `success: true, result_count: 0, results: []`.

### Search-method values (radio `searchMethod`)

The same form supports other lookups by selecting a different radio before submitting: `s`=Business Name, `a`=Registered Agent, `r`=President, `c`=Secretary, `m`=Manager, `f`=File Number, `e`=Keyword, `p`=Partial Word. (Name/Agent/officer searches reveal extra Last/First/Business-Name sub-fields via the form's `index.js`.)

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **Akamai Bot Manager gates the search POST, not the form GET.** The input page (`/businessentitysearch/`) renders cleanly every time. The challenge fires only on submitting the search (`POST /businessentitysearch/businessentitysearch`). Plan stealth around the submit, not the initial load.
- **Two distinct block shapes were observed, intermittently, on the same stealth + residential-proxy config:**
  1. **reCAPTCHA "Challenge Validation"** image challenge, served inline with HTTP **200** (title `Challenge Validation`). Has refresh/audio/info icons and a **SKIP** button — Akamai's own challenge widget, not a plain Google checkbox.
  2. **`ERR_HTTP2_PROTOCOL_ERROR`** — Akamai resets the POST connection (Chrome "This site can't be reached", title `apps.ilsos.gov`, url `chrome-error://chromewebdata/`).
     Which one you get appears to depend on per-session/IP reputation and how the form was submitted.
- **The platform did NOT auto-solve the image challenge** during testing, and the `solve` command did not reliably clear the Akamai-served reCAPTCHA either. Don't assume stealth or `solve` will clear it.
- **A residential proxy makes it _better_, not worse, here.** Stealth-only (no proxy) produced the harder HTTP2 connection reset; adding a residential `proxy` produced the (occasionally recoverable) reCAPTCHA path. Keep `proxy: { proxy: "residential" }` on. This is the opposite of some gov sites — do not drop the proxy expecting improvement.
- **No API / GET shortcut — confirmed.** The legacy app only accepts the POST form, and the action endpoint is behind the same Akamai gate. Don't waste time hunting for a JSON endpoint or a GET-param variant.
- **A JS `.click()` submit is worse than a real click.** Submitting via an `evaluate`'d `document.getElementById('btnSearch').click()` reliably triggered the HTTP2 reset (no genuine pointer event for Akamai's sensor to record). Use the `click` method on `#btnSearch`, which produces a real pointer event and at least reaches the (softer) reCAPTCHA path.
- **Prefer stable CSS selectors over accessibility refs.** Snapshot refs are per-session/per-snapshot; a stale ref silently clicks the wrong element (observed: a stale Submit ref left the page on the form, a false "challenge cleared" reading). Drive off `#searchValue`, `#btnSearch`, and `input[name='searchMethod'][value='s']`; take a fresh `snapshot` only to confirm a selector.
- **The query is a plain string to the `type` method.** `{ "method": "type", "params": { "selector": "#searchValue", "text": "smith ventures" } }` — multi-word values need no escaping. Target `#searchValue` directly.
- **`searchValue` is capped at 30 chars** (`maxlength=30`). Truncate long queries.
- **Dwelling ~5s on the form before interacting** lets the Akamai sensor (`/akam/13/…`, `/JI_uid/…` beacon POSTs) collect telemetry; submitting within ~2s of load is an extra bot signal. Dwell did not by itself defeat the gate, but it is necessary baseline hygiene.
- **Database terms forbid bulk/automated use** ("available to the public for individual searches only … may not be used to copy or download bulk information"). Respect single-lookup usage.

Observed either a 'Challenge Validation' reCAPTCHA image challenge ('Please solve this quick test to confirm you are a person, not a robot') or an ERR_HTTP2_PROTOCOL_ERROR connection reset. A stealth session with a residential proxy (and the solve command) did not clear the challenge during testing."
}
```
