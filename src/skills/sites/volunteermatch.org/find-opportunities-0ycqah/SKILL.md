      return search data — they 301-redirect to
      idealist.org/en/volunteer-in-<city>, which still requires the Algolia XHR
      to actually fetch results. Use the URL only to parse the caller's intent,
      then issue the Algolia call directly.

# VolunteerMatch Find Opportunities

## Purpose

Search for volunteer opportunities by location, cause/interest, skills, format, schedule, time commitment, and audience — and return each match as structured JSON (opportunity ID + VM legacy ID, title, host org, full description, cause/skill tags, format, location + lat/lon, schedule, time commitment, audience, group/family flags, photo, canonical URL). Read-only — never submits the "I Want to Help" / Apply form. Captures the region-wide total ("X opportunities matching your criteria") and supports pagination.

## When to Use

- Daily / weekly monitoring of new volunteer postings matching a cause + location.
- Bulk extraction of opportunities for a metro to feed an event-discovery or volunteer-matching agent.
- Single-opportunity detail extraction from a `volunteermatch.org/opp{ID}.jsp` URL or an Idealist `/volunteer-opportunity/{hash}-...` URL.
- Anywhere you'd otherwise scrape the VolunteerMatch search UI — the underlying search index is a public Algolia endpoint, faster and structurally richer than HTML scraping.

## Workflow

**Critical context: VolunteerMatch.org has sunset and 301-redirects every request to Idealist.org.** Idealist acquired VolunteerMatch and migrated the entire opportunity catalog (the legacy postings carry a `vmLegacyId` field). All searching now happens against Idealist's catalog, which is served by a public Algolia search index — no auth, no anti-bot, single HTTP GET per query.

The optimal path is **direct Algolia search** against the `idealist7-production-action-opps` index using the publicly-embedded search-only API key. Browser fallback (driving Idealist's search UI) works but pays a ~100× cost premium because the search page is fully CSR (initial HTML returns a Remix shell with zero opportunity refs; results render after Algolia XHRs fire client-side). Lead with the API.

> **Transport note (Browserless):** This is a plain HTTPS JSON API (Algolia) — the HTTP GET examples below are canonical and run from any client. Only under restricted egress, route a call via `browserless_function` (which executes in a browser page context: `page.goto('https://nsv3auess7-dsn.algolia.net/')` then `page.evaluate` a same-origin `fetch`; project/summarize in-eval since the text return caps ~200k chars). The search-only Algolia key is public by design, but never route any private key/secret through the browser gratuitously — keys go only to their documented host.

| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Full `volunteermatch.org/search/?...` URL                                                     | Treat it as a legacy redirect — parse `l=`/`v=`/`k=`/`o=` params, map to Idealist filters (table below), then issue the Algolia call. The 301 lands on `idealist.org/en/volunteer-in-<city>` which is just the UI route, not the API.                                                      |
| Full `idealist.org/en/volunteer?...` URL                                                      | Parse `q=`, `locationName=`, `radius=`, `sort=`, `page=`, and the faceted param names listed below; pass through.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Free-form location (city + state, ZIP, "Brooklyn, NY", "Remote")                              | Geocode to lat/lon (cache locally, e.g. `Brooklyn, NY → 40.6782,-73.9442`). For "Remote"/"Virtual" use `filters=locationType:REMOTE` and skip `aroundLatLng`.                                                                                                                              |
| Lat/lon + radius                                                                              | Drop into `aroundLatLng=<lat>,<lng>` and `aroundRadius=<meters>` (radius is meters; 25 mi = 40000).                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Direct opportunity URL (`/en/volunteer-opportunity/<32-hex>-<slug>` or legacy `/opp{id}.jsp`) | Skip search. For Idealist URLs, the 32-hex segment is the `objectID` — call `/1/indexes/{INDEX}/{objectID}` directly. For VM legacy URLs (`opp1234567.jsp`), use the `numericFilters=vmLegacyId=<id>` search trick (see Gotchas — `vmLegacyId` is **not** a facet, only a numeric filter). |

### 2. Map cause / interest area to Idealist's `areasOfFocus` taxonomy

Idealist uses an expanded but mostly compatible taxonomy. Apply this mapping when the caller asks for a VolunteerMatch cause name:

| VolunteerMatch cause         | Idealist `areasOfFocus` value(s)                                     |

Full enum (56 values, sorted by population): `COMMUNITY_DEVELOPMENT, HEALTH_MEDICINE, SENIORS_RETIREMENT, VOLUNTEERING, EDUCATION, HUNGER_FOOD_SECURITY, VETERANS, HOUSING_HOMELESSNESS, MENTAL_HEALTH, ARTS_MUSIC, DISABILITY, HUMAN_RIGHTS_CIVIL_LIBERTIES, INTERNATIONAL_RELATIONS, CHILDREN_YOUTH, WOMEN, ANIMALS, DISASTER_RELIEF, ENVIRONMENT, CRIME_SAFETY, RELIGION_SPIRITUALITY, SCIENCE_TECHNOLOGY, FAMILY, IMMIGRANTS_OR_REFUGEES, SPORTS_RECREATION, POVERTY, CIVIC_ENGAGEMENT, LEGAL_ASSISTANCE, ECONOMIC_DEVELOPMENT, MEDIA, CLIMATE_CHANGE, PHILANTHROPY, RACE_ETHNICITY, POLICY, LGBTQ, RURAL_AREAS, ENTREPRENEURSHIP, JOB_WORKPLACE, COMMUNICATIONS_ACCESS, VICTIM_SUPPORT, AGRICULTURE, RESEARCH_SOCIAL_SCIENCE, URBAN_AREAS, FINANCIAL_LITERACY_PERSONAL_FINANCE, TRANSPORTATION, CONFLICT_RESOLUTION, MEN, PRISON_REFORM, SEXUAL_ABUSE_HUMAN_TRAFFICKING, TRAVEL_HOSPITALITY, WATER_SANITATION, SUBSTANCE_ABUSE_ADDICTION, TRANSPARENCY_OVERSIGHT, REPRODUCTIVE_HEALTH_RIGHTS, CONSUMER_PROTECTION, ENERGY, MICROFINANCE`.

### 3. Build the Algolia request

Endpoint (search), `GET`:

```
https://nsv3auess7-dsn.algolia.net/1/indexes/{INDEX}
    ?query={q}
    &hitsPerPage={1-100, default 20}
    &page={0-based}
    &filters={URL-encoded facet filter expression}
    &numericFilters={URL-encoded numeric filter}
    &aroundLatLng={lat},{lng}
    &aroundRadius={meters}     // OR aroundRadius=all to disable distance scoring
    &facets=*                  // optional — returns facet counts for refinement UI
    &maxValuesPerFacet=100
    &x-algolia-application-id=NSV3AUESS7
    &x-algolia-api-key=c2730ea10ab82787f2f3cc961e8c1e06
```

Index name depends on sort order:

| Sort                             | Index name                                        |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Best Match / Relevance (default) | `idealist7-production-action-opps`                |
| Most Recent / Newest             | `idealist7-production-action-opps-published-desc` |

(There is **no** "Closest" sort replica — Idealist relies on Algolia's geo-ranking built into the relevance index when `aroundLatLng` is set. "Sort by distance" is implicit in the relevance index whenever a geo filter is present.)

The `NSV3AUESS7` app ID and `c2730ea10ab82787f2f3cc961e8c1e06` search API key are public, embedded in Idealist's initial HTML at `/en/volunteer` (look for the `"algolia":{"appId":...}` block in the SSR payload). Both are search-only keys — they cannot mutate or read non-search indices. Treat them as long-lived constants but re-extract from the initial HTML if a 403 ever fires (key rotation has not been observed in the wild but Idealist could change them).

### 4. Filter expression syntax

Multi-value facets use `OR`, multi-facet conjunction uses `AND`, group with parens:

```
(areasOfFocus:ANIMALS OR areasOfFocus:ENVIRONMENT) AND locationType:ONSITE AND canBeDoneInADay:true AND welcome:FAMILIES
```

URL-encode the entire expression and pass as `filters=`. Filterable attributes (verified):

| Attribute                          | Type         | Values                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

**Date filtering** — `starts` and `ends` are numeric Unix epoch facets, use `numericFilters`:

```
numericFilters=starts >= 1780000000,ends <= 1782592000
```

URL-encode the whole expression. Comma separates AND clauses. Useful date params (the Idealist UI calls them `endsGT` "ends greater than" and `startsLT` "starts less than" but they boil down to `numericFilters`):

- "Available this weekend" → `numericFilters=ends >= <fri_epoch>,starts <= <sun_epoch>`
- "Available within the next 30 days" → `numericFilters=ends >= <now>,starts <= <now+2592000>`
- "Ongoing" (no fixed dates) → results where `starts` and `ends` are `null` — filter client-side rather than via Algolia (numeric filters can't match null).

### 5. Geo + radius

```
aroundLatLng=40.6782,-73.9442&aroundRadius=40000   # Brooklyn, NY · 25 mi
```

Radius is **meters**. Conversions: 5 mi = 8000, 10 mi = 16000, 25 mi = 40000, 50 mi = 80000, 100 mi = 160000. Omit `aroundRadius` (or set `aroundRadius=all`) to drop the distance filter while still using `aroundLatLng` for ranking.

Free-form locations should be geocoded with Idealist's own location resolver (the search UI POSTs to its `/api/v3/locations/search` endpoint to convert "Brooklyn, NY" → lat/lng), or with any third-party geocoder. The result-page URL param `locationName=Brooklyn%2C+NY%2C+USA` is purely a UI breadcrumb — it does not affect the Algolia call; the lat/lon does.

### 6. Pagination

`hitsPerPage` max **100**, default **20**. `page` is 0-based. **Total fetchable hits are capped at 1000** (page=49 at hitsPerPage=20, or page=9 at hitsPerPage=100). Above that, Algolia returns `{message: "you can only fetch the 1000 hits for this query…"}`. The `/browse` cursor method is blocked for this search-only key (403). To extract more than 1000 results, **narrow the query with additional filters or a tighter geo radius** until the result set drops below 1000.

### 7. Decode each hit

`response.hits[i]` schema (verified fields):

| Field                                                                                                            | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

`response.nbHits` is the region-wide total. `response.nbPages` is min(`ceil(nbHits/hitsPerPage)`, 50). Pagination beyond `nbPages-1` returns empty `hits` not an error.

### 8. Fetch org detail (optional)

Idealist's org pages are SSR and embed structured org data in two places:

1. **JSON-LD `<script type="application/ld+json">`** at the top of the page — `@type:"Organization"` block with `name`, `url`, `description` (mission HTML), `address` (PostalAddress: `streetAddress`, `addressLocality`, `addressRegion`, `postalCode`, `addressCountry`), `areaServed`, `knowsAbout` (human-readable cause labels).
2. **Algolia org index** `idealist7-org-production` — same `appId`/`searchApiKey` work. Fetch by `objectID`:
   ```
   GET https://nsv3auess7-dsn.algolia.net/1/indexes/idealist7-org-production/{orgID}
       ?x-algolia-application-id=NSV3AUESS7&x-algolia-api-key=c2730ea10ab82787f2f3cc961e8c1e06
   ```
   Returns org fields including `website`, `phone`, `facebookUrl`, `twitterUrl`, `linkedinUrl`, `yearFounded`, `ein`, and total opportunity counts.

### 9. Read-only — never click apply

The "I Want to Help" / "Apply Now" button on either VolunteerMatch's legacy detail page or Idealist's opp detail page launches a multi-step modal that posts to `/api/v3/applications`. **Never click it, never POST to that endpoint.** Stop at the search results + detail extraction.

### Browser fallback

If for some reason the Algolia endpoint is unreachable (highly unlikely — it's served by Algolia's global CDN, not Idealist), drive the UI:

Run one `browserless_agent` call (no proxy — direct REST calls succeed without stealth or residential IP) whose `commands` drive the Remix UI in one call — the session persists across calls, keyed by `proxy`/`profile`:

1. `{ "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "https://www.idealist.org/en/volunteer?q=<urlenc-query>&locationName=<urlenc-location>&radius=<miles>&areasOfFocus=<UPPER_ENUM>&locationType=ONSITE&sort=newest&page=2", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } }`
2. `{ "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 3000 } }` — the search XHR fires 1–3 s after load.
3. `{ "method": "evaluate", "params": { "content": "(()=>JSON.stringify([...document.querySelectorAll('article[data-qa-id=\"search-hit\"]')].map(a=>({url:a.querySelector('a[href^=\"/en/volunteer-opportunity/\"]')?.href, ...}))))" } }` — extract opportunity cards from the rendered DOM. The cards are `<article data-qa-id="search-hit">` blocks; each contains an `<a href="/en/volunteer-opportunity/...">` (the canonical URL), title, org name, and a snippet. (`snapshot` also works if the selectors drift.)
4. Cost premium is ~50–100× the API call — only use as a last resort.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **VolunteerMatch.org is dead — 301 redirects everywhere.** Confirmed 2026-05-16: every path under `volunteermatch.org` returns `301` with `Location: https://www.idealist.org/...`. The redirect map: `/` → `/volunteermatch` (landing page), `/search/?l=<location>` → `/en/volunteer-in-<city>` (geo-aware), `/search` (no params) → `/en/volunteer`, `/about`/`/orgs`/`/api/*` → `/volunteermatch`. **There is no live VolunteerMatch API to call.** The entire catalog has been merged into Idealist's Algolia index. Posts that originated on VM carry `fromVm:true` and a populated `vmLegacyId`.
- **Algolia search-only key is public and stable.** `NSV3AUESS7` / `c2730ea10ab82787f2f3cc961e8c1e06` are embedded in Idealist's SSR HTML by design. They're rate-limited but un-versioned. If a 403 ever fires, re-fetch `https://www.idealist.org/en/volunteer` and re-parse the `"algolia":{...}` JSON block — it's in the initial HTML, no JS execution needed.
- **`vmLegacyId` is NOT a facet filter — only a numeric filter.** `filters=vmLegacyId:1234567` returns 0 hits. Use `numericFilters=vmLegacyId=1234567` (or `numericFilters=vmLegacyId%3D1234567` URL-encoded). This is the only way to look up an opportunity by its old VM ID via search.
- **1000-hit pagination cap.** `hitsPerPage * (page+1) ≤ 1000`. Beyond that, Algolia returns `{message: "you can only fetch the 1000 hits for this query"}`. The `/browse` cursor endpoint is **blocked** for this key (403 "Method not allowed"). To extract more than 1000, narrow filters until total drops below the cap. Practical pattern: paginate by `published` timestamp window (e.g. last 7 days, then previous 7, etc.) using `numericFilters=published >= <a>,published <= <b>`.
- **`aroundRadius` is meters, not miles.** The Idealist URL uses miles (`radius=25`), but the Algolia API takes meters (`aroundRadius=40000`). Don't pass through the URL value blindly — multiply by 1609.
- **Geo on remote opps is misleading.** For `locationType:REMOTE` opportunities, `_geoloc` is usually the host org's HQ coordinates, not where the volunteer needs to be. The volunteer can be anywhere within `remoteZone`. Always check `locationType` before treating `_geoloc` as "where you go".
- **Sort options are just two: `relevance` and `newest`.** No "Closest" replica exists. When `aroundLatLng` is set, the relevance index already factors distance into ranking (Algolia's built-in geo-ranking). For pure-distance sort, fetch `hitsPerPage=100&aroundLatLng=...` and re-sort client-side by `_rankingInfo.geoDistance` (request `getRankingInfo=true` to surface that field).
- **The full opportunity body is in `description` on the search hit.** No detail-page fetch needed for the body — Algolia returns the entire description with each hit (verified at 2000+ chars). Detail-page fetch is only needed for JSON-LD breadcrumbs and the host-org contact card.
- **Canonical URL slug is optional.** `https://www.idealist.org/en/volunteer-opportunity/{32-hex-objectID}` 200s and serves the same page as the full `/en/volunteer-opportunity/{objectID}-{slug}` URL. Build URLs with the slug for SEO/sharing but the bare-ID form is what to canonicalize against.
- **Three locales — `en`, `es`, `pt`.** Each hit carries `url.en`, `url.es`, `url.pt` paths. Filter `locale:en` to limit to English-language postings; default index returns all three.
- **`canBeDoneInADay` is the closest proxy for "Less than 2 hours" / "Half day" / "Full day" buckets.** Idealist collapsed VM's four time-commitment buckets into a single boolean. If callers ask for "Less than 2 hours" specifically, return `canBeDoneInADay:true` results and document that finer-grained time-commitment data is no longer indexed.
- **`welcome:TEENS` is the only age-restriction filter — Idealist does not separate "Kids (under 13)" from "Teens (13-17)".** VM's "Kids" filter has no Idealist equivalent; if callers ask for it, fall back to `welcome:FAMILIES` (which generally implies "kid-friendly").
- **No skill-level-of-detail filter for "tutoring" vs "ESL tutoring".** Idealist's `functions` enum has `MENTOR_TUTOR`, `TEACHING_AND_INSTRUCTION`, `ESL`, `EDUCATION`, `READING_WRITING` — they're separate values, not hierarchical. Pass them all in an OR clause for "tutoring" intent.
- **`source:IDEALIST` is the dominant provenance.** `GOLDEN` and `NYCPARKS` are third-party content imports. `fromVm:true` selects the legacy VM migration cohort (about 870 postings as of 2026-05-16). If a caller specifically wants "VolunteerMatch listings" rather than "all volunteer listings" — surface both `fromVm:true` results AND the broader Idealist catalog, but flag the distinction in the response (e.g. `"provenance": "vm_legacy" | "idealist_native"`).
- **No anti-bot, no proxies, no stealth needed.** A direct HTTPS GET against `nsv3auess7-dsn.algolia.net` works from any cloud IP (no `browserless_agent`/`browserless_function` required for the API). Idealist's own pages also serve cleanly without stealth — verified by fetching the search-results SSR HTML and the opp/org detail pages without any 403/captcha.
- **Detail-page JSON-LD is `@type: "JobPosting"`, not "VolunteerOpportunity".** Idealist (re-)uses Google's JobPosting schema for SEO regardless of the listing being volunteer/unpaid. The `employmentType` field reads `"VOLUNTEER"` so you can disambiguate. Don't be fooled by the schema name.
- **The volunteer "Apply" flow goes through Idealist's own ATS.** `hasAts:true` opportunities apply in-app via a POST to `/api/v3/applications`. `hasAts:false` (rare) redirects to the org's external apply URL — but **both paths are write operations and outside this skill's scope**.

For a single-opportunity detail extraction (caller passed a direct URL), return the same `opportunities[0]` shape wrapped as `{ "opportunity": {...}, "organization": {...} }` — no pagination metadata needed.
