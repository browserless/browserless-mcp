# Replay Demo

## Purpose

Provide a stable localhost test page for Browserbase session replay playback.

## When to Use

Use this skill when you need to verify that the skill page modal can load and play a stored replay session.

## Workflow

1. Open the replay modal from the skill page.
2. Wait for the HLS manifest to load.
3. Confirm the video timeline advances and segment requests succeed.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

This is a synthetic local test skill. The replay content comes from a real Browserbase session, but the markdown and reference image are only for frontend validation.

## Expected Output

A skill page on localhost with a reference image and a working Watch Replay modal.
