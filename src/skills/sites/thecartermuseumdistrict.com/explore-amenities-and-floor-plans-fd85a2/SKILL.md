      Works as a fallback when a plain fetch is blocked — drive a
      `browserless_agent` session with `proxy: { proxy: "residential" }`
      (Cloudflare-fronted), `goto` each page, then grab the whole DOM with one
      `html` (selector `body`) command per page and parse offline. ~100x more
      expensive than a plain fetch; per-element card reads exhaust an LLM agent's
      turn budget, so only the whole-DOM-dump-then-parse approach converges.
  - method: api
    rationale: >-
      No usable data API exists for this property — RentCafe pages are fully
      server-rendered and no RENTCafeAPI/XHR availability feed was found. Parse
      the embedded application/ld+json block plus the rendered floor-plan cards
      instead.

# Explore Amenities and Floor Plans — The Carter (Museum District, Houston)

## Purpose

Return a structured summary of The Carter apartment building: (1) **community amenities** (building-wide), (2) **apartment amenities** (in-unit features), (3) **neighborhood amenities** (curated nearby dining / nightlife / recreation points of interest), and (4) the full **floor-plan catalog** — every plan with its bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, "starting at" price, security deposit, and current availability status. Read-only; never submits applications, tour requests, or contact forms.

## When to Use

- A renter or research agent wants a one-shot overview of what the building and its location offer.
- You need a machine-readable floor-plan table (beds / baths / sqft / price / deposit / availability) for comparison, monitoring price changes, or feeding a rental-search aggregator.
- Anywhere you'd otherwise scrape the marketing site's HTML — the data is server-rendered, so a plain HTTP fetch is faster, cheaper, and more reliable than driving a browser.

## Workflow

The Carter runs on **RentCafe (Yardi)** and **server-renders the full page HTML on every request** — including a machine-readable `application/ld+json` block and all amenity / floor-plan content. There is **no client-side data API to call and no JS hydration required**. The optimal path is therefore a `GET` of three pages plus regex/JSON parsing — no clicking, no waiting on spinners. A residential proxy is needed only because the site sits behind Cloudflare (see Gotchas); the content itself is fully present in the first HTML response (HTTP 200). Walking the rendered DOM card-by-card costs ~100× more (the floor-plan page DOM is ~520 KB; an LLM browser agent that reads it element-by-element blows past a 30-turn budget without finishing — confirmed across two autobrowse iterations).

Because the site is Cloudflare-fronted, drive each `GET` through a `browserless_agent` call with `proxy: { proxy: "residential" }` — a real browser clears the challenge. Per page, run `{ "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "<url>", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } }` (follow the `http→https` and apex→`www` 301s), then either fold the parse into an `evaluate` (parse the JSON-LD + `fp-container` cards in-page and return a compact JSON projection) or grab the raw markup once with `{ "method": "html", "params": { "selector": "body" } }` and parse offline with the logic below.

1. **Floor plans** — `GET https://www.thecartermuseumdistrict.com/floorplans`
   - **Structural data (beds/baths/sqft) comes from JSON-LD.** The page contains exactly one `<script type="application/ld+json">` whose `@type` is `["LocalBusiness","ApartmentComplex"]`. Parse it; `accommodationFloorPlan[]` lists every plan as `{ name, numberOfBedrooms, numberOfFullBathrooms, floorSize.minValue }`. This is the authoritative source for dimensions (27 plans).
   - **Pricing / deposit / availability come from the rendered cards** (NOT in the JSON-LD). Split the HTML on `class="...fp-container..."` — there are 27 such cards. Strip tags from each card's first ~300 chars; the head reads like:
     `A1 1 Bed 1 Bath 723 Sq. Ft. Starting at $1,940 Deposit: $400 ...`
   - Per-card regex: `Starting at \$([\d,]+)` → starting price; `Deposit: \$([\d,]+)` → deposit.
   - **Availability rule:** a card showing `Starting at $X` (and a "View Availability" link) has units available now. A card showing **`Call for details`** (and a "Contact Us" link, no price) has **no current availability** — price is on request. These two states are mutually exclusive; key off the presence of a `Starting at $` price.

2. **Building amenities** — `GET https://www.thecartermuseumdistrict.com/amenities`
   - The page has two tabbed `<ul>` lists, **both fully present in the static HTML** (no click needed): **Community Amenities** (~16 `<li>`) and **Apartment Amenities / Features** (~20 `<li>`).
   - Strip carousel-label noise from each `<li>` — a trailing `"1 of 1"` / `"1 of 2 2 of 2"` is the image-gallery counter, not amenity text. A trailing `*` on an amenity name means **select units / waitlisted** (e.g. `Guest Suite*`, `Floor-to-Ceiling Windows*`).
   - The **Pet Policy** block is on this same page: max 2 pets, no weight restriction, $25/mo pet rent, $350 non-refundable pet fee + $350 refundable pet deposit (per pet).

3. **Neighborhood amenities** — `GET https://www.thecartermuseumdistrict.com/mapsanddirections`
   - This is the page the site's **"Neighborhood"** nav item points to (not `/neighborhood`, which 404s). It carries three POI `<ul>` lists under the headings **Food**, **Night Life**, and **Recreation** — each `<li>` is a named nearby establishment (RentCafe-curated). Use these as the "neighborhood amenities."
   - Property facts (address `4 Chelsea Blvd, Houston, TX 77006`, phone `(281) 501-3337`, 19-story building, beds 1–3, baths 1–3.5) are in the JSON-LD on every page.

4. **Emit JSON** matching the schema in **Expected Output** below.

### Browser fallback

If the in-page `evaluate` parse ever misbehaves, fall back to the whole-DOM-dump path: in the same stealth + residential-proxy `browserless_agent` session, `goto` each of the three URLs (`waitUntil: "load"`), then `{ "method": "html", "params": { "selector": "body" } }` **once per page** and parse the returned HTML with the same JSON-LD + `fp-container` logic above. **Do not** try to read cards one-by-one via per-element selectors (e.g. a `text` command per `#fp-container-<id>`) — that pattern exhausted a 30-turn agent budget without finishing in testing. One whole-DOM dump per page + offline parse is the only browser approach that converges.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **Cloudflare-fronted.** `https://www.thecartermuseumdistrict.com` is behind Cloudflare (`Cf-Ray` / `__cf_bm` cookie). Drive the `goto` over a residential proxy (`proxy: { proxy: "residential" }`) to avoid challenge pages. With a residential proxy all three pages returned HTTP 200 and the full content on the first request; no captcha or JS challenge was hit across testing. Content is NOT gated behind the cookie banner (OneTrust) — it's already in the HTML.
- **JSON-LD has no price or availability.** `accommodationFloorPlan[]` gives only name + beds + baths + sqft (`floorSize.minValue == maxValue`, single value per plan). For price/deposit/availability you MUST parse the rendered `fp-container` cards.
- **`Call for details` ≠ free / sold out — it means "no live unit, contact leasing."** 15 of 27 plans (most A9/A10, B7, and ALL townhomes TH1–TH4 and penthouses PH1–PH5) show "Call for details" with no price. Treat as `availability_status: "call_for_details"`, `starting_price: null`. Only 12 plans had a live "Starting at $" price at capture time. These flip frequently as inventory changes — re-fetch for current state.
- **Last floor-plan card bleeds into the page footer.** When splitting on `fp-container`, the final card's block extends to end-of-document (footer + inline JS that contains the literal string "View Availability" in a template). Determine availability from the card **head** (first ~300 chars) and key off the `Starting at $` price, not a whole-block search for "View Availability" — otherwise the last plan (PH5) is falsely marked available.
- **Amenity `<li>` length filter matters.** Two real apartment-feature items are long sentences (`Solar Window Shades & Blackout Shades in Each Bedroom`, `Views of Downtown, Galleria, & The Texas Medical Center *`). A `length < 60` filter silently drops them; use `< 90`. The full lists are 16 community + 20 apartment items.
- **Carousel labels pollute amenity text.** Each amenity `<li>` may end with `" 1 of 1"` or `" 1 of 2 2 of 2"` (gallery counters). Strip a trailing `(\s*\d+ of \d+)+` before recording.
- **No dedicated neighborhood/location/gallery routes.** `/neighborhood`, `/location`, and `/gallery` all 404. Neighborhood POIs live only on `/mapsanddirections`.
- **Trailing `*` on an amenity = "select units only."** Carried verbatim from the site; preserve it so downstream consumers know it's not building-wide.
- **Deposits scale by bedroom count, not by plan availability:** $400 (1-bed), $600 (2-bed), $900 (3-bed flat C1), $1,000 (townhomes & penthouses). Present even on `call_for_details` plans.
- **Don't waste time looking for a RentCafe JSON/availability API.** This property's pages are fully server-rendered; there was no `RENTCafeAPI.aspx`, `/api/...`, or XHR availability feed in the markup or network trace. The JSON-LD block + rendered cards are the source of truth.

**Notes on the example values:** captured during testing on 2026-06-03. The amenity lists, plan names, dimensions, and deposits are stable site content; `starting_price` and `availability_status` are live inventory and will change — always re-fetch for current pricing. At capture time 12 of 27 plans were available with live pricing ($1,940–$3,819); the remaining 15 (incl. all townhomes and penthouses) were "call for details."
