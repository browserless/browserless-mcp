# Medicare.gov Hospital Quality Rating

## Purpose

Given a hospital reference — CMS provider/CCN ID, hospital name + city/state, or a Care Compare URL — return the hospital's CMS quality ratings as a structured JSON record. Includes the overall 1–5 star rating, the five sub-domain group ratings (mortality, safety of care, readmission, patient experience, timely & effective care), HCAHPS patient-experience composite scores, common-condition mortality/readmission rates (heart attack, heart failure, pneumonia, stroke, COPD), hospital-acquired infection (HAI) Standardized Infection Ratios for CLABSI / CAUTI / SSI / MRSA / C.diff, emergency-department timeliness, full hospital metadata, and the canonical Care Compare URL. Supports a `compare_to` input that returns multiple hospitals side-by-side plus national and state benchmarks. Read-only; never clicks Save Hospital, Print, Sign In, Compare-cart submit, or any mutation control.

## When to Use

- "Show me the CMS star rating for Mayo Clinic Rochester."
- "How does HCA Florida Citrus Hospital compare to the state average for sepsis mortality?"
- A patient-experience research agent benchmarking three named hospitals on HCAHPS composites.
- A discharge-planning tool that needs ED timeliness and readmission rates for one hospital plus the national/state benchmark for each metric.
- A scheduled job pulling quality data for an entire health-system roster (lookup-by-CCN at scale).

## Workflow

The medicare.gov Care Compare UI is a thin Angular SPA over a Kong-gated internal API (`https://www.medicare.gov/api/care-compare/*`). The exact same per-hospital quality data is **also** published — at the row level, refreshed quarterly — through the **CMS Provider Data Catalog** (data.cms.gov) DKAN datastore, which is fully public, auth-free, no anti-bot, and supports per-CCN filtering, contains-matching, multi-condition queries, and joins with state/national benchmark companion datasets. Iter-1 verification across 7 datasets for CCN 240010 (Mayo Clinic Hospital Rochester) returned 100% of the fields the Care Compare card surfaces. **Lead with the PDC API.** Use the browser flow only when you specifically need the rendered Care Compare card (e.g. for screenshot-in-the-loop tasks). Calling the medicare.gov Kong gateway directly is a confirmed dead end (`401 No API key found in request`).

### 1. Resolve the input to a CCN

The CMS Certification Number (CCN) — sometimes called the Provider ID or Facility ID — is the 6-digit primary key across every Hospital Compare dataset.

| Input shape                                                        | Resolution                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 6-digit CCN (e.g. `240010`)                                        | Use directly.                                                                           |
| Hospital name + state                                              | Query Hospital General Information with `contains` on `facility_name` + `=` on `state`. |
| Hospital name + city + state                                       | Same as above, then filter by `citytown` client-side (case-insensitive).                |
| `https://www.medicare.gov/care-compare/details/hospital/{ccn}` URL | Extract the trailing 6-digit path segment.                                              |
| `https://www.medicare.gov/care-compare/results?...` URL            | No CCN in URL — extract `zipcode=` + provider type and run a name-keyed PDC query.      |

```bash
# Name → CCN lookup (Hospital General Information = dataset xubh-q36u)
curl 'https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/api/1/datastore/query/xubh-q36u/0?conditions%5B0%5D%5Bproperty%5D=facility_name&conditions%5B0%5D%5Bvalue%5D=mayo&conditions%5B0%5D%5Boperator%5D=contains&conditions%5B1%5D%5Bproperty%5D=state&conditions%5B1%5D%5Bvalue%5D=MN&conditions%5B1%5D%5Boperator%5D=%3D&limit=10'
# → 240010 MAYO CLINIC HOSPITAL ROCHESTER, ROCHESTER, MN, rating=5
```

### 2. Pull the per-CCN datasets

Issue one `GET` per dataset, filtering by `facility_id=<CCN>`. All 7 datasets share the same authentication-free DKAN datastore endpoint. Field names are stable across quarterly refreshes.

| Skill data point                                                 | Dataset ID  | Title                                       | Key fields returned                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Hospital-acquired infections (HAI) Standardized Infection Ratios | `77hc-ibv8` | Healthcare Associated Infections - Hospital | Six measure families, each with 6 rows: `_SIR` (the actual SIR — what's surfaced on Care Compare), `_NUMERATOR`, `_DOPC` (device-days denominator), `_ELIGCASES`, `_CILOWER`, `_CIUPPER`. HAI_1 = CLABSI, HAI_2 = CAUTI, HAI_3 = SSI Colon, HAI_4 = SSI Abdominal Hysterectomy, HAI_5 = MRSA Bacteremia, HAI_6 = C.diff. `compared_to_national` carries the four bucket levels: `Better than the National Benchmark`, `No Different than National Benchmark`, `Worse than the National Benchmark`, `Not Available`. |

Other `_condition` values: `Cataract Surgery`, `Colonoscopy`, `Heart Attack or Chest Pain`, `Pregnancy and Delivery`, `Preventive Care`, `Sepsis Care`.                                                                     |

### 3. Construct the canonical Care Compare URL

```
https://www.medicare.gov/care-compare/details/hospital/{ccn}?city=&state={STATE}&zipcode={ZIPCODE}&page=1&from=hospital&type=Hospital
```

This URL works only when reached **through the SPA's in-app router** — see Site-Specific Gotchas. Return it as the canonical link anyway; users who click it land on home and search by ZIP.

### 4. Assemble the unified output

Merge the per-CCN rows from each dataset into one record per hospital (see `## Expected Output` for the schema). Map each `compared_to_national` enum string into a normalized boolean trio `{better, no_different, worse}` for downstream filtering. Preserve raw `score` values as strings (CMS does — they signal "Not Available" / "Not Applicable" via string sentinels, not nulls).

### 5. Handle `compare_to`

When `compare_to: [<ccn or name+state>, ...]` is set, run steps 1–4 in parallel for each. After all hospitals are resolved, query each national + state benchmark companion dataset **once** (not per-hospital) and embed the result as a top-level `benchmarks.national` and `benchmarks.state.<state-code>` block. The PDC DKAN datastore tolerates ~5 req/s without rate-limiting in our testing; sequential per-hospital fan-out is fine.

### 6. Browser fallback (only when the user needs the rendered Care Compare card)

Use this when (a) the consumer is a visual workflow that wants a screenshot of the per-hospital card, or (b) the user explicitly requested the medicare.gov UI. Skip otherwise — the API path returns the same data at ~100× lower cost.

1. **Residential proxy is mandatory.** Akamai protects the site; bare sessions get challenged. Run the whole flow inside a single `browserless_agent` call with the top-level arg `proxy: { proxy: "residential", proxyCountry: "us" }`, and keep the warm-up → nav → click → extract chain in that one call's `commands` array so cookies/session persist. There is no separate session-create/keep-alive/release step. The session does not tear down on return — it persists keyed by the call's `proxy`/`profile`, so a later call carrying the same config reconnects to it; batching into one call just avoids accidentally dropping that config.
2. **Land on the search-results page directly** with full query params — this bypasses the Welcome → Hospital tile → ZIP-input click chain:
   ```json
   {
     "method": "goto",
     "params": {
       "url": "https://www.medicare.gov/care-compare/results?searchType=Hospital&page=1&zipcode={ZIPCODE}&sort=closest&radius=25",
       "waitUntil": "load",
       "timeout": 45000
     }
   }
   ```
   Then `{ "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 8000 } }` — hospital cards render lazily after the SPA fires `POST /api/care-compare/provider?autoExpand=true`. Never gate on networkidle; it hangs on this SPA.
3. **Click into a card** by the hospital's anchor text (not by `href` pattern — see gotcha below): `{ "method": "click", "params": { "selector": "..." } }` targeting the visible link text (confirm the selector via `{ "method": "snapshot" }` if it misses). The SPA navigates to its in-app detail route, which renders the full quality card.
4. **Read off the rendered DOM** with an `{ "method": "evaluate", "params": { "content": "(()=>{ /* project card fields */ })()" } }` command. No release step — there is nothing to release.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **Deep-link `/care-compare/details/hospital/{ccn}` does NOT work as a plain URL load.** Confirmed in iters 1, 2, and 4: a `page.goto(detailUrl)` from a cold session returns the home-page chrome only (`finalUrl: /care-compare/`, `h1: "Menu"`). The SPA's router treats `/details/hospital/*` as an internal route reachable only through the in-app navigation graph (home → ZIP → Hospital → Search → click result). Construct the canonical URL anyway for output / linking — but **never** rely on `goto` for scraping the detail page. Click through from `/results?...` instead.
- **`/api/care-compare/*` is auth-walled.** Every endpoint observed (`/refresh`, `/news-updates`, `/datafeed`, `/geocode/search`, `/provider?autoExpand=true`) returns `401 {"message":"No API key found in request"}` to direct requests. The API key is embedded in the SPA bundle (`main.<hash>.js`, ~1MB). A `browserless_function`/`browserless_agent` has no small fetch cap, but don't ship the whole bundle back — the text result is ~200k-char capped, so slice/grep it in-page and return only matching lines. Do **not** waste cycles trying to reverse this key — the public PDC datastore is the right path.
- **The SPA bundle is ~1MB.** Browserless imposes no small response cap (a raw HTTP fetch of the bundle used to 502 on a 1MB limit), but the ~200k-char text-return limit still means you must not return the whole file. To inspect bundle internals, use a `browserless_function` — `page.goto` the bundle origin, then `page.evaluate` to slice/grep the source (project only the matching lines) — or introspect runtime globals via an `evaluate` command.
- **Akamai bot challenge is handled transparently by a residential-proxy `browserless_agent`** (`proxy: { proxy: "residential" }`) but bare sessions see `/DgEq/aOIa/g3e9/o16Ycw/m55OcGf3k5J7rSN9iS/...` POSTs (the _abck challenge URL) and a JS-shell HTML on first navigation. Always run the browser fallback with the residential proxy set.
- **Provider-type tile click is fragile.** The home page uses `mat-list-item` tiles, not standard `<button>`s. `page.getByRole("button", { name: /hospital/i })` matched "Menu" instead of the Hospital tile in iter 1. Prefer the direct `/results?searchType=Hospital&zipcode={ZIP}` deep-link, which **does** work — it bypasses the tile.
- **`<a href="/care-compare/details/hospital/...">` may not exist.** Iter 4 confirmed `waitForSelector("a[href*='/care-compare/details/hospital/']")` times out at 30 s. Angular's `routerLink` directives do not always materialize as `<a href>` in the DOM until hover or focus. Don't `waitForSelector` on that href; instead click by visible text — a `{ "method": "click", "params": { "selector": "..." } }` targeting the hospital-name link (confirm the ref via `{ "method": "snapshot" }` if it misses).
- **`hospital_overall_rating: "Not Available"` is a real value.** Critical-access hospitals, brand-new hospitals, VA hospitals, children's hospitals, and rural emergency hospitals (REH) often lack a star rating. Treat as `null` in normalized output, surface the raw `"Not Available"` string in a `_raw` block. For REH, query the parallel datasets: `97xg-v3wv` (Rural Emergency Hospital - Timely and Effective Care) and `zez1-ka2w` (REH - Unplanned Hospital Visits).
- **HAI `compared_to_national` enum capitalization differs from Complications/Deaths.** HAI uses `Better than the National Benchmark` (lowercase "than", and "Benchmark" not "Rate"). Complications/Deaths uses `Better Than the National Rate`. Normalize before comparison.
- **HCAHPS rows are one-per-measure-question.** Filter to `hcahps_measure_id = 'H_STAR_RATING'` for the summary star (5-stars at Mayo Rochester), or `H_*_STAR_RATING` for per-composite stars (Nurse communication, Doctor communication, Cleanliness, Quietness, Discharge information, Communication about medicines, Overall hospital rating, Recommend hospital). `H_*_LINEAR_SCORE` rows carry the numeric 0–100 linear mean. The `_A_P`/`_U_P`/`_SN_P` triplets sum to 100% and represent the always/usually/sometimes-or-never response distribution.
- **ED measure IDs `OP_18a` through `OP_18d` decompose by patient class.** `OP_18a` = all ED patients, `OP_18b` = ED patients excluding transferred + psychiatric (the "general" wait time most often quoted), `OP_18c` = psychiatric/mental health patients, `OP_18d` = patients transferred to another facility. National median for `OP_18b` was 161 minutes; Minnesota state median was 130; Mayo Rochester scored 245. Lower is better.
- **PDC `properties` filter expects an array, not a comma-string.** `properties=facility_id,facility_name` returns `400 JSON Schema validation failed`. Use `properties[0]=facility_id&properties[1]=facility_name`, or just omit `properties` and read every column (response sizes are small enough — Hospital General Info is ~5–7 KB per CCN).
- **PDC SQL endpoint exists at `/api/1/datastore/sql?query=...` but uses bracket-DSL syntax** (`[SELECT ...][FROM ...][WHERE ...]` — not standard SQL). The query parameter must reference each dataset by its UUID, not its slug. For most use cases the conditions API at `/api/1/datastore/query/{slug}/0` is simpler — it handles `=`, `contains`, `starts with`, `<>`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`.
- **Read-only constraints:** do not click Save Hospital, the heart-icon Add to Favorites, Print, Sign In, Compare cart submit, or Send Feedback. These are mutation surfaces with confirmation dialogs but the rule is no-mutation regardless.
- **Refresh cadence:** PDC datasets update **quarterly** (typical CMS cycle: October release of Care Compare data covers Jul-prior-year through Jun-current-year). Add `start_date`/`end_date` to every emitted measure so consumers can detect stale data.

## Expected Output

Single-hospital response shape (the `compare_to` shape is identical with a `hospitals: [...]` array and a top-level `benchmarks` block):

For `compare_to: ["360180", "Cleveland Clinic Florida + FL"]` the top level becomes:

```json
{
  "hospitals": [ { "ccn": "240010", ... }, { "ccn": "360180", ... }, { "ccn": "100247", ... } ],
  "benchmarks": {

    }
  },
  "fetched_at": "<iso8601-utc>"
}
```

When the requested hospital is not found in the PDC (CCN doesn't exist or is for a non-Hospital provider type — nursing home, dialysis facility, home health agency), return:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "reason": "ccn_not_a_hospital",
  "looked_up": "240010",
  "available_provider_types": ["NursingHome", "HomeHealth"]
}
```

When the input was a hospital name that returned multiple matches in the target state:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "reason": "ambiguous_name",
  "matches": [
    {
      "ccn": "240010",
      "name": "MAYO CLINIC HOSPITAL ROCHESTER",
      "city": "ROCHESTER",
      "state": "MN"
    },
    {
      "ccn": "240018",
      "name": "MAYO CLINIC HEALTH SYSTEM IN RED WING",
      "city": "RED WING",
      "state": "MN"
    },
    {
      "ccn": "240043",
      "name": "MAYO CLINIC HEALTH SYSTEM - ALBERT LEA AND AUSTIN",
      "city": "ALBERT LEA",
      "state": "MN"
    }
  ]
}
```

When the hospital exists but is not publicly rated (critical access, brand-new, VA — `hospital_overall_rating: "Not Available"`):

```json
{ "ccn": "241333", "name": "MAYO CLINIC HEALTH SYSTEM ST. JAMES", "overall_rating": { "stars": null, "footnote": "Results are not available for this reporting period", "raw": "Not Available" }, ... }
```
