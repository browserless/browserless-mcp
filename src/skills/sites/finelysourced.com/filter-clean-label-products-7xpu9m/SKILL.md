recommended_method: hybrid
alternative_methods:
  - method: api
    rationale: >-
      /api/search/suggestions?q= returns a 3KB JSON with the seven top-level
      categories and live product counts in one call — ideal for catalog sizing.
      The same endpoint's products[] field is a fixed list of recent additions
      and ignores the q parameter, so it is NOT a search API.
  - method: url-param
    rationale: >-
      All filter dimensions are single-key URL routes (/categories/{slug},
      /tags/{Tag%20Name}, /brands/{slug}, /search?q=, /products?page=N) served
      as plain HTML behind Cloudflare with no auth, no JS-only rendering, and no
      anti-bot. A lightweight goto + in-page evaluate (or a same-origin fetch)
      is the cheapest, fastest path. Combine filters by client-side slug
      intersection — the server has no multi-key filter syntax.
  - method: browser
    rationale: >-
      A full browser session works (the same URLs render identically) but pays
      a ~10–100× cost premium with no functional gain — the data is fully
      present in the static HTML response. Use a heavier browser flow only for
      screenshots or if the lightweight goto+evaluate path is ever blocked.

# FinelySourced Clean-Label Product Filter

## Purpose

Given a clean-label intent — one or more lifestyle/ingredient filters (seed-oil free, organic, non-GMO, glyphosate-free, grass-fed, regenerative, paleo, keto, gluten-free, etc.), an optional category (food, supplements, personal care, home, wellness, apparel, fast food/restaurants), an optional free-text term, and an optional brand — return a curated list of matching products from FinelySourced.com with title, brand, breadcrumb category, key features / certification badges, tag list, description, and the vendor's outbound buy link. Read-only; never submits the "Suggest a product" form, the newsletter form, the Sign In/Up form, or any other write surface.

## When to Use

- "Find seed-oil-free + organic + grass-fed snacks I can actually buy."
- "Show clean-label deodorants / toothpastes / cookware that are non-toxic and aluminum-free."
- "Top-rated tallow products on a clean-label directory, with vendor links."
- "Intersect two or more dietary filters (e.g. paleo + keto + dairy-free) across the catalog."
- Surfacing the small (~140-product), human-curated FinelySourced catalog as discovery, not a price-comparison shop. (FinelySourced does not store retail prices — `Current Offers` are referral-code discounts only.)

## Workflow

FinelySourced.com is a small, public, curated directory (~140 products, ~58 sub-categories, hundreds of single-word tags, 9 brand pages). The web UI is plain server-rendered HTML behind Cloudflare with **no auth, no JS-only routes, no anti-bot**, so the optimal path is a lightweight **`browserless_agent`** `goto` + in-page `evaluate` that parses the static HTML (anchor hrefs, JSON-LD) and returns a compact projection. No proxy and no stealth are needed — pass no `proxy` arg. A heavier browser flow is only needed for screenshots — not for any data extraction. Pagination is server-side via `?page=N`; multi-filter intersection is a client-side join because the site exposes **single-dimension URL filters only** (one category OR one tag OR one brand OR one free-text query per URL).

The flow has three layers — pick one or combine them client-side:

### 1. Resolve the filter intent into FinelySourced URL primitives

| User filter dimension                     | URL primitive                                                                                                                                                                                             | Example                                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Top-level category                        | `/categories/{slug}?page=N&sort=newest\|popular\|name`                                                                                                                                                    | `/categories/food-beverages?sort=popular`                                                                                              |
| Sub-category (e.g. oils-fats, deodorants) | Same `/categories/{slug}` route — 58 valid slugs                                                                                                                                                          | `/categories/deodorants`                                                                                                               |
| Single ingredient/lifestyle tag           | `/tags/{Tag%20Name}?page=N` — **Title Case, URL-encoded spaces, no kebab-case**                                                                                                                           | `/tags/Seed%20Oil%20Free`, `/tags/Non-Gmo`, `/tags/Grass%20Fed`, `/tags/Regenerative`, `/tags/Glyphosate-Free`, `/tags/Usda%20Organic` |
| Brand                                     | `/brands/{slug}` — 9 known slugs (lineage-provisions, paleovalley-via-product, maple-hill, raw-farm-usa, white-oak-pastures, yonder-way-farm, alexandre-family-farm, chroma, cowboy-colostrum, greco-gum) | `/brands/lineage-provisions`                                                                                                           |
| Free-text keyword                         | `/search?q={url-encoded}&sort=relevance\|name\|rating\|newest`                                                                                                                                            | `/search?q=tallow&sort=rating`                                                                                                         |
| Entire catalog                            | `/products?page=N` (~18 per page, 8 pages, ~140 products total)                                                                                                                                           | `/products?page=3`                                                                                                                     |

**Use `/api/search/suggestions?q=` to discover the seven top-level categories with live `product_count` in one ~3KB JSON call.** This is the only cheap catalog-size endpoint. The `q=` parameter is silently ignored — the products array is fixed (most-recently-added 8) and is **not** keyword-filtered, so it is NOT a search API. Treat it as a category-count + recents probe only.

```bash
curl -s 'https://finelysourced.com/api/search/suggestions?q=' \
  | jq '.categories[] | {slug, product_count}'
# → food-beverages:98  home-kitchen:10  personal-care:9
#   clothing-apparel:8  supplements-wellness:7  pantry-staples:3  fast-food-restaurants:2
```

This is a plain unauthenticated HTTPS JSON endpoint — the `curl` above is canonical and runs from any client. Only under restricted egress, route it via `browserless_function`: `page.goto('https://finelysourced.com/')` first (a bare `fetch` has no network egress until the page is navigated), then `page.evaluate(async () => (await fetch('/api/search/suggestions?q=')).json())` — same-origin, so it works.

### 2. Fetch the candidate product slug set

For each URL primitive selected in step 1, load the HTML with a `browserless_agent` `goto` and parse it in-page with an `evaluate`. Each listing page (`/categories/*`, `/tags/*`, `/brands/*`, `/search`, `/products`) renders product cards as `<a href="https://finelysourced.com/products/{slug}">…</a>`. Extract slugs and de-duplicate in the eval and return a compact array via `.value`; ignore the `/products/suggest` entry (it's the "Suggest a product" CTA, not a real product).

```json
{ "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "https://finelysourced.com/tags/Seed%20Oil%20Free", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } }
{ "method": "evaluate", "params": { "content": "(()=>{ const s=new Set(); document.querySelectorAll('a[href*=\"/products/\"]').forEach(a=>{ const m=a.href.match(/\\/products\\/([a-z0-9-]+)$/); if(m && m[1]!=='suggest') s.add(m[1]); }); return JSON.stringify([...s]); })()" } }
```

Read the deduped slug list off `.value`. Category pages (`/categories/{slug}`) **do** embed a clean `ItemList` JSON-LD block at the page footer — parse it in the same `evaluate` for `{position, name, url}` triples when present:

```json
{
  "method": "evaluate",
  "params": {
    "content": "(()=>{ const out=[]; document.querySelectorAll('script[type=\"application/ld+json\"]').forEach(s=>{ try{ const d=JSON.parse(s.textContent); const g=d['@graph']||[d]; g.filter(x=>x['@type']==='ItemList').forEach(x=>out.push(x)); }catch(e){} }); return JSON.stringify(out); })()"
  }
}
```

Tag pages, brand pages, and `/search` pages do **not** include an `ItemList` block — fall back to anchor-href extraction for those.

**To combine multiple filters (e.g. "seed-oil free AND organic AND grass-fed in oils-fats"), load each filter's slug set separately and intersect them client-side.** The site has no multi-filter URL syntax — `?tag=`, `?tags[]=`, `?filter=`, `?cert=` are all silently dropped. Pick the smallest-cardinality dimension first (usually the rarest tag like `/tags/Glyphosate-Free` or `/tags/Regenerative%20Farming`) so you minimize per-product detail loads in step 3.

### 3. Hydrate each candidate slug into a curated recommendation

For each unique slug in the intersected set, `goto` `https://finelysourced.com/products/{slug}` and extract these fields with an in-page `evaluate` (return a compact JSON object via `.value`) — they are all stable selectors as of 2026-05-19:

| Field                 | Extraction pattern                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `title`               | `<h1 class="…">TITLE</h1>`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `description_short`   | `<p class="lg:text-sm …">TEXT</p>` immediately after the `<h1>` (also available as the `<meta name="description">` content, truncated to ~200 chars)                                                                                                                                             |
| `description_about`   | The first `<p>` inside the `>About</h…>` block (richer, full sentences)                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `breadcrumb_category` | Anchor text in `<nav>` breadcrumb — usually `Home › Products › {Top Cat} › {Sub Cat}` (the only place the product's actual category is in the page)                                                                                                                                              |
| `brand`               | `<a href="https://finelysourced.com/brands/{slug}">…</a>` near the H1 (may be absent if no dedicated brand page)                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `brand_logo`          | `<img …src="https://images.finelysourced.com/brands/logos/…">` next to title                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `tags[]`              | All `href="https://finelysourced.com/tags/{TagName}"` inside `id="tags-section"` — URL-decode the names                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `key_features[]`      | All `<span class="text-gray-700 text-sm">FEATURE</span>` inside the "Key Features" block (these are the green-checkmark bullets like "Glyphosate Free", "Rich in CLA", "Aluminum-Free") — **richer than the tag list, often includes ingredient-level callouts not surfaced as `/tags/*` links** |
| `certifications[]`    | Plain-text labels inside the "Certifications & Badges" block (e.g. "Seed-Oil Free", "Glyphosate Free", "USDA Organic") — parse by stripping HTML tags inside that section                                                                                                                        |
| `current_offers[]`    | The "Current Offers" block; usually a referral-code discount tied to the `FINELYSOURCED` code (e.g. `"10% off on orders over $99 for new customers"`). **Not a retail price** — FinelySourced does not store prices                                                                              |
| `vendor_url`          | `<a class="… Visit Website Button" href="HTTPS://…?utm_source=finelysourced.com&utm_medium=directory&utm_campaign=referral">` — the canonical outbound buy link                                                                                                                                  |
| `finelysourced_url`   | `https://finelysourced.com/products/{slug}` (the page itself, for citation back)                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Emit one record per surviving slug. Rank by a heuristic of the caller's choice — `popular` sort on the upstream category, `rating` sort on a search query, or match-count across the user's requested filter tags.

### Browser fallback (only needed if the lightweight goto+evaluate path is blocked at some future point)

The same primitives work in a heavier browser flow — `{ "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "...", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } }` each URL then `snapshot` / screenshot the rendered page. Category and tag pagination is wired to JavaScript that re-fetches the same URL and swaps the `#product-results` div in-place, so server-side rendering with `?page=N` query strings continues to work without JS execution. There is no infinite-scroll or login wall to defeat.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **No multi-dimensional URL filters.** `/categories/oils-fats?tag=Seed%20Oil%20Free`, `/tags/Organic?category=supplements-wellness`, `?certifications[]=organic`, `?filter=...` — all silently dropped. The server returns the unfiltered single-dimension page in every case. Client-side slug intersection is the only path. Verified 2026-05-19 against `oils-fats?tag=Seed Oil Free` → byte-identical to bare `oils-fats`.
- **`/api/search/suggestions?q=X` ignores `q` entirely.** Same 3324-byte response for `q=cookie`, `q=tallow`, `q=zzzzzz`, and `q=`. The `products[]` array is a fixed list of the 8 most-recently-added products; the `categories[]` array is the seven top-level categories with `product_count` totals. Useful for catalog sizing, useless for keyword search. Use `/search?q=…` (HTML) for real keyword search.
- **`/api/search?q=…` returns 403.** Confirmed blocked behind an auth check — don't bother probing it. Use the HTML `/search?q=…` route instead.
- **`/api/products` and `/api/categories` don't exist.** Both 404 to the SPA fallback HTML.
- **Tag URLs are Title Case with literal `%20`, not lowercase-kebab.** `/tags/Seed%20Oil%20Free` works; `/tags/seed-oil-free` returns the 404 SPA fallback. Discover the canonical name from `/tags` (the index page) — it's the anchor text exactly. Some tags use hyphens (e.g. `/tags/Non-Gmo`, `/tags/Gluten-Free`, `/tags/Glyphosate-Free`); others use `%20` (e.g. `/tags/Seed%20Oil%20Free`, `/tags/Grass%20Fed`, `/tags/Usda%20Organic`). When unsure, scrape `/tags` once and cache the map.
- **Pagination is `?page=N` and only renders when `count > 18`.** Sub-categories like `oils-fats` (7 products) or `supplements-wellness` (7) return a single un-paginated page; top-level `food-beverages` (98) paginates 1–6 at 18/page. Tag pages paginate at 12/page (verified on `/tags/Organic`). `/products` paginates at 18/page, pages 1–8. Always check the rendered pagination nav before assuming you've exhausted a list.
- **Sort options differ by route.** `/categories/{slug}` accepts `?sort=newest|popular|name` (default newest). `/search?q=…` accepts `?sort=relevance|name|rating|newest` (default relevance). Tag and brand pages have no sort UI and silently ignore the param — `/tags/Organic?sort=popular` is byte-identical to `/tags/Organic`.
- **No retail price field exists anywhere.** Product pages show only `Current Offers` — referral-code discount text tied to the `FINELYSOURCED` partner code (e.g. "10% off on orders over $99 for new customers"). The `$99`is the discount threshold, not the product price. If the caller asked for a price filter, document that the site can't satisfy it and either drop the filter or fall through to the vendor's`vendor_url` to fetch real price.
- **The `Brand` link on a product page does not always resolve.** Only 9 brand slugs render a real brand page (`alexandre-family-farm`, `chroma`, `cowboy-colostrum`, `greco-gum`, `lineage-provisions`, `maple-hill`, `raw-farm-usa`, `white-oak-pastures`, `yonder-way-farm`). Other brands (e.g. `/brands/paleovalley`) 404 even when the product is clearly a Paleovalley product — the brand directory is much smaller than the product directory. Treat brand pages as a discovery dimension, not a guaranteed reverse-lookup.
- **`/products/suggest` is the "Suggest a Product" CTA, not a product.** It appears in every category page and search result list as the trailing card. Always filter it from the candidate slug set.
- **External vendor links carry a `?utm_source=finelysourced.com&utm_medium=directory&utm_campaign=referral` suffix.** Some links also have a `?selling_plan=…` or `?FINELYSOURCED` discount-code query appended. Pass through verbatim — stripping the UTM may break vendor attribution.
- **Cloudflare is in front but does not gate.** All a direct HTTP fetch calls returned 200 from a bare (no-stealth, no-proxy) us-west-2 client; the `Set-Cookie: XSRF-TOKEN, finelysourced_session` is for the future POST forms (newsletter, suggest, login) and isn't required for GETs. Don't waste budget on a residential proxy / stealth.
- **Total catalog is ~140 products as of 2026-05-19.** This is a small, hand-curated directory; for popular filters (`/tags/Seed%20Oil%20Free` returned 8, `/tags/Organic` returned ~42 across 4 pages), exhaustive enumeration is cheap (≤ 10 page fetches). Don't paginate aggressively past the visible page count — pages beyond the last rendered link return 200 with zero products, not a 404.
- **Product detail pages occasionally include a `Promote your product` CTA labelled with a "Reach more customers" call to action.** This is an ad slot for vendors, not part of the product data. The block uses generic text like "Reach users exploring {tags}" — ignore it.
