# Find a Funda Property by Address and Get Its Status

## Purpose

Given a Dutch property address (street + house number, ideally with postcode and
city), locate its listing on funda.nl and return the current listing status
(for sale / sold / under offer / for rent / rented) together with core listing
facts: canonical address, property type, asking price (or rent), and the
listing URL. Read-only — never contacts an agent, places a bid, or saves a
favourite.

## When to Use

- Checking whether a specific address is currently listed on Funda and, if so,
  whether it is still available, sold, under offer, or rented.
- Monitoring the status of a known address over time (e.g. "is Singel 109-F
  still for sale?").
- Enriching an address with Funda's canonical listing data (type, asking price,
  time on market, sale date) before a deeper workflow.
- Anywhere you'd otherwise scrape the Funda search UI — the address→listing
  resolution + HTTP fetch path below is faster, cheaper, and dodges Funda's
  Akamai bot wall and its flaky location-only search box.

## Workflow

The optimal path pairs the `browserless_search` tool with a single proxied page
load — no interactive DOM driving. Funda detail pages are fully server-rendered
(status, address, price, and a JSON-LD block are all in the initial HTML), so
once you have the listing URL a single `browserless_agent` `goto` yields
everything. The only non-trivial part is resolving an address to its listing
URL — Funda's own search box can't do it reliably (see Gotchas), so use
`browserless_search` instead.

1. **Resolve the address to a Funda detail URL** with the `browserless_search` tool:

   ```
   browserless_search  query: "{street} {number} {postcode} {city} funda"
   ```

   In the returned `results[]`, take the first entry whose `url` host is
   `www.funda.nl` and whose path starts with `/detail/`. The result `title`
   already encodes the status, in the form
   `"{Type} {verb}: {street} {postcode} {city} | Funda"` where `verb` is one of
   `te koop` (for sale), `verkocht` (sold), `te huur` (for rent),
   `verhuurd` (rented). **Verify** the result's street + house number + city
   match the queried address before trusting it — for some addresses the exact
   house number is not the top hit and a neighbouring number is returned
   instead (treat a mismatch as ambiguous / not found).

2. **Load the detail page** through a residential proxy (Funda is behind
   Akamai Bot Manager — a plain load can be challenged; a residential proxy
   passes). One `browserless_agent` call, navigate then read the HTML:

   ```json
   {
     "proxy": { "proxy": "residential" },
     "commands": [
       {
         "method": "goto",
         "params": {
           "url": "{detail_url}",
           "waitUntil": "load",
           "timeout": 45000
         }
       },
       { "method": "html", "params": { "selector": "html" } }
     ]
   }
   ```

   Check the `goto` HTTP status. `200` → parse the HTML; `404`
   (`"Deze pagina kunnen we niet vinden"`) → the listing has been de-listed,
   report `status: "not_found"`.

3. **Extract the data** from the returned `content` HTML:
   - **Status** (authoritative): the `Status` row in the features list
     (Kenmerken → Overdracht). Rendered as `Status</dt>...<dd>{value}</dd>`.
     Values: `Beschikbaar` (available / for sale), `Verkocht` (sold),
     `Verkocht onder voorbehoud` (sold subject to conditions),
     `Onder bod` (under offer); rentals use `Beschikbaar` / `Verhuurd`.
   - **Address, type, price** from the JSON-LD block
     (`<script type="application/ld+json">`, the first one is the property):
     `name` = street + number, `@type` = `["{PropertyType}", "Product"]`
     (type is element 0, e.g. `Appartement`, `Huis`),
     `offers.price` = asking price in EUR, `address.{streetAddress,
addressLocality, addressRegion}`. Postcode is in the `<title>` /
     `description` (not in the JSON-LD address).
   - **Sold-only extras** (when status is `Verkocht*`): the features list also
     carries `Aangeboden sinds` (listed since), `Verkoopdatum` (sale date) and
     `Looptijd` (time on market).

4. **Return** the assembled JSON (see Expected Output). The page `<title>` verb
   and, for sold listings, the `/verkocht/` URL segment both corroborate the
   `Status` field — cross-check them.

### Browser fallback

If `browserless_search` can't resolve the address or the direct load fails,
drive a stealth `browserless_agent` session and `goto` the detail URL directly.
The page is server-rendered, so a single `snapshot` (≈470 refs) contains the
status, price, type and full features list — no clicks needed. Read the `Status`
value from the snapshot. **Do not** read the body `text` (it returns the
consent-banner CSS/JS, not content) — use `snapshot`. Accept the cookie dialog
("Alles accepteren") with a `click` if it blocks the view. This was validated
end-to-end (correct extraction). Note that constructing a detail URL from
scratch is impossible without the listing's numeric id, so the browser fallback
still depends on `browserless_search` resolving the URL.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **Akamai Bot Manager**: Funda sets `ak_bmsc` / `bm_s` / `bm_ss` cookies and an
  `X-Akamai-Transformed` header. A `browserless_agent` `goto` **with
  `proxy: { proxy: "residential" }`** returns clean 200s for both search and
  detail pages; assume a plain (no-proxy) load may be challenged. The probe of the bare homepage reported
  "no antibots", but that only reflects the `301` root redirect — the app
  pages are Akamai-protected.
- **The homepage search box is location-only and unreliable for addresses.**
  The combobox placeholder is "Zoek op plaats, buurt of postcode"; it resolves
  cities / streets / postcodes / neighbourhoods, **not full house numbers**.
  Typing `Singel 109`, `Singel Amsterdam`, or even a bare postcode `1012 VG`
  returned "We kunnen deze locatie niet vinden" in automated sessions. Also,
  setting the value directly (a `fill`-style write) does not fire the
  per-keystroke events the React combobox listens to, so no suggestion request
  fires — you must use real keystrokes (`type`). Even then suggestions
  frequently failed to render. Don't build the skill on this control.
- **`free_text` query param does not filter.** `https://www.funda.nl/zoeken/koop?free_text=...`
  is reflected in the page's JSON-LD but the SSR result set stays the full
  ~95,768-listing default regardless of the value (confirmed across three
  distinct queries incl. a nonsense string). Confirmed dead end — don't use it
  for address lookup.
- **Geo-suggestion API is CORS-locked.** The combobox calls
  `POST https://listing-search-wonen.funda.nl/geo-wonen-alias-prod/_search/template`
  with body `{"id":"searchbox_20250621","params":{"value":"...","area_types":[...]}}`.
  It is an Elasticsearch stored-template endpoint scoped to the page origin —
  a cross-origin `fetch()` from an injected script fails with "Failed to fetch".
  Don't waste time trying to call it directly; and even if reached it returns
  _areas_, not individual listings.
- **Sold listings move under `/detail/koop/verkocht/{city}/...`** (an extra
  `/verkocht/` path segment) and return 200 with `Status: Verkocht`. But some
  older sold/withdrawn listings are fully de-listed and return HTTP 404 — handle
  404 as `not_found`, not as an error.
- **Search-API resolution is good but not perfect.** Exact, well-known addresses
  (e.g. `Singel 109-F Amsterdam`) resolve to the right detail URL as the top
  hit; for some addresses the precise house number is absent and a neighbouring
  number is returned. Always verify street + number + city against the result
  title/JSON-LD; on mismatch, report `ambiguous`/`not_found` rather than the
  wrong listing.
- **JSON-LD `@type` is an array** like `["Appartement","Product"]` — the human
  property type is element `[0]`. The JSON-LD `address` omits the postcode;
  read the postcode from the `<title>` (`"...: {street} {postcode} {city} |
Funda"`).
- **Prices are k.k.** ("kosten koper" — buyer pays transfer costs) for `koop`;
  rentals (`/detail/huur/...`) show a per-month figure. `offers.price` is the
  numeric value without the `k.k.` suffix.
