# realestate.com.au Property Data Extraction

## Purpose

Given a realestate.com.au property URL — or a street address that can be resolved to one — return structured property data including the full address, geographic coordinates, listing status, current price (or price range / sold price), key statistics (beds, baths, parking, land size, floor area, property type), the agent + agency, and the property's historical sale prices. Read-only — never submits enquiries, never starts a contact form, never signs in. The same skill handles for-sale, sold, and off-market addresses.

## When to Use

- Building a property research dataset (one-shot or scheduled) — e.g. compare current listings to historical sale prices in a suburb.
- Enriching a CRM or buyers' brief with REA-sourced beds/baths/land-size + agent contact.
- Computing capital-gain analytics from `historical_sales` for a single dwelling.
- Looking up a non-listed address to confirm beds/baths/land before contacting the owner ("off market" path).

## Workflow

The richest single page is the **Property Pages address profile** at `/property/{slug}/`. It carries the Property history (every recorded sale with date + price + agency), property features (beds/baths/parking/land-size/property-type), the lat/lon coordinates (embedded in the Google Static-Maps URL), and — when the address has an active listing — a deep-link to the `/property-{type}-...` listing detail page where agent contacts + current asking price + description live. The recommended flow is to land on Property Pages first, then conditionally fetch the listing page if a current price/agent is needed.

**A bare session works** for the page-rendering surface; PerimeterX/Kasada returns 429 on direct HTTP fetches but does not challenge the headed browser path. Stealth is on by default and a residential `proxy` is **not strictly required** for the rendering path on the addresses tested, but keep it on by default — Kasada's bot-score tracker is opaque and some IP ranges hit a captcha interstitial. The fetch + GraphQL paths are confirmed blocked (see Gotchas).

### 1. Use a stealth session with residential proxy (optional but safer)

Batching the whole flow — nav → wait → extract, plus the conditional listing-page fetch — inside ONE call's `commands` array is the convenient default (fewer round-trips, no risk of dropping the session config). The session persists across separate calls too, keyed by `proxy`/`profile`, so the Kasada cookies stay warm as long as you carry the same config. Stealth is on by default; add a residential `proxy` on the call (repeat the **same** one on every call you make so you reconnect to the same session):

```json
{ "proxy": { "proxy": "residential", "proxyCountry": "au" } }
```

The proxy is optional for the rendering path but safer — drop it only if cost matters and the call rate is low (< 10/hr).

### 2. Resolve to a Property Pages slug

You have one of three inputs:

**(a) A listing URL** like `https://www.realestate.com.au/property-house-vic-richmond-151242968`:

- Open the listing first. The breadcrumb (item 5) is the street address. Build the Property Pages slug from it: `{number}-{street-name}-{street-suffix-abbr}-{suburb-lower}-{state-lower}-{postcode}`. Street suffixes are abbreviated: Street→`st`, Road→`rd`, Avenue→`av`, Parade→`pde`, Terrace→`tce`, Court→`ct`, Drive→`dr`, Place→`pl`, Lane→`la`, Crescent→`cr`, Highway→`hwy`. For apartments/units, prefix `unit-{unitNumber}-`: `5/19 River Street` → `unit-5-19-river-st-richmond-vic-3121`.
- Or skip slug derivation entirely: the listing page itself carries address + beds/baths/parking/land-size/price/agent. Use Property Pages only when historical sales or lat/lon are required.

**(b) A sold URL** like `https://www.realestate.com.au/sold/property-apartment-vic-richmond-150805280`:

- Same shape as a listing URL but the price strip reads `$815,000 Sold on 02 May 2026`, and a `[Property history](https://www.realestate.com.au/property/{slug}/)` link is rendered just under the price — follow that link rather than rebuilding the slug.

**(c) A bare street address** (no URL):

- Construct `/property/{slug}/` directly using the same slugging rules above. If the slug is wrong, REA serves the closest match in a "Did you mean?" header — pivot to the proposed slug.

### 3. Open the Property Pages URL

In the `browserless_agent` `commands` array:

```json
[
  {
    "method": "goto",
    "params": {
      "url": "https://www.realestate.com.au/property/6-stawell-st-richmond-vic-3121/",
      "waitUntil": "load",
      "timeout": 45000
    }
  },
  { "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 4000 } },
  { "method": "text", "params": { "selector": "body" } }
]
```

Important: the `goto` `load` wait frequently times out because REA keeps an analytics socket open after DOM-ready. The error is non-fatal — the page IS fully rendered; the 4s `waitForTimeout` after `goto` is enough. Prefer folding the field parsing into an `evaluate` (parse in-page, return a compact projection) over shipping the raw body.

### 4. Extract fields from the rendered body

The rendered body is structured and predictable — the section labels below (`## Property history`, `## Property features`, the h1) are the same anchors the page exposes. Use these anchors:

| Field                                                   | Where in the markdown                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `address`                                               | The `# {Street}{Suburb, STATE postcode}` h1 just below the breadcrumb (note: no space between street and suburb — split on the suburb name).                                                                                                                        |
| `bedrooms / bathrooms / parking`                        | A 3-element list directly under the address. Order is **beds, baths, parking**.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `listing_status`                                        | The line above the h1 reads `For sale`, `Sold`, or `Off market`.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `property_type`                                         | The line after the stats group: `House`, `Apartment`, `Unit`, `Townhouse`, `Land`, `Townhouse`.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `price_display`                                         | The next line. For for-sale: literal display string like `$1,200,000 - $1,300,000`, `Contact Agent`, `Expressions of Interest`, `$1.7m-$1.9m`, etc. For sold: omitted on Property Pages — read from the `## Property history` section below.                        |
| `property_features` (land_size, floor_area, year_built) | `## Property features` section. Land size as `Land size: 268 m²`, floor area as `Floor area: 100 m²` (or `-` when missing), year built when known.                                                                                                                  |
| `historical_sales`                                      | `## Property history` section. Each entry is: a year header, the literal word `Sold` or `Listed for sale`, a `#### ${price}` heading, then `Sold {date} by {agency}` line. When there's no history, the section reads `No history available`.                       |
| `lat / lon`                                             | Extract from the static-map embed URL via regex `markers=icon[^&]*%7C(-?[0-9.]+)%2C(-?[0-9.]+)` on the rendered body text OR the page HTML. Also reproduced in the "Local area map of Richmond" Google Static-Maps embed — same coordinates. Precision: 8 decimals. |
| `listing_url`                                           | When status = `For sale`: the `[View listing](https://www.realestate.com.au/property-{type}-...)` link. Absent on off-market and sold-history-only pages.                                                                                                           |

Parse the price-range display string with `^\$([\d,]+)\s*-\s*\$([\d,]+)$` for `price_low`/`price_high`; treat `Contact Agent`, `Expressions of Interest`, `Auction`, `$XXXm` shorthand, and single-number displays as `price_display` only (don't fabricate a range).

### 5. If a current asking price + agent contact is required, also open the listing page

When Property Pages shows a `View listing` link, follow it to grab:

- `price_display` and `indicative_price` — listing pages often show "Contact Agent" as the headline plus an `Indicative price: $X,XXX,XXX - $Y,YYY,YYY` sub-line (regulated in VIC by the Statement of Information).
- `agent`, `agency`, `agent_phone` (truncated — REA masks the last 3 digits unless you click "Call", which we don't do).
- Full prose `description` and AI-generated `property_highlights` (3 bullets).
- `inspection_times`, `auction_time` when present.

For sold listings (`/sold/property-...`), the same template renders but the price strip becomes `${sale_price} Sold on {date}`.

### 6. Geocoding fallback

If the static-map regex doesn't match (rare, but possible when REA serves a placeholder map), open the listing page — the "Map" embed there carries the same `markers=icon%7C{lat}%2C{lon}` pattern. As a last resort, the address itself plus the postcode is enough to geocode externally; REA never publishes lat/lon as numeric DOM attributes — it's only embedded in the static-map URL.

### 7. Session teardown

No session-release step — the session persists across calls keyed by `proxy`/`profile`, so there's nothing to explicitly tear down. Batching the whole flow (nav → extract → conditional listing-page fetch) inside ONE call's `commands` array is convenient, but if you split across calls, carry the same `proxy`/`profile` each time so the Kasada cookies stay warm; dropping or changing it lands you in a different, blank session.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **Direct HTTP fetch is blocked.** A raw HTTP fetch of a listing URL (even through a residential proxy) returns **429 + Kasada PerimeterX cookies** (`x-kpsdk-ct`, `KP_UIDz`). The full browser path (`browserless_agent` `goto` + `evaluate`) is the only reliable surface. Don't waste cycles trying to bypass Kasada via raw HTTP, persisted GraphQL queries, or REST endpoints under `lexa.realestate.com.au` / `services.realestate.com.au` — they're whitelisted to the mobile app's signed tokens.
- **The `goto` `load` wait times out on most listing/property pages.** REA keeps a long-lived analytics WebSocket open, so the `load` event never fires. The error is non-fatal — a `waitForTimeout` of 4000 after the `goto` is enough; DOM is ready before `load` would fire anyway.
- **A bare session works but margins are thin.** Both stealth-plus-residential-proxy and a bare stealth session rendered the same listing/property pages on test runs. However, Kasada is on the perimeter, so traffic spikes / repeated IDs from the same IP push you into a captcha interstitial. Default to a residential `proxy` for production; only drop the proxy arg if cost matters and the call rate is low (< 10/hr).
- **Listing URL structure has TWO formats.** `/property-{type}-{state}-{suburb}-{id}` is the for-sale path; `/sold/property-{type}-{state}-{suburb}-{id}` is the sold path. Same template but the "Property history" link only appears on the sold variant. The for-sale variant requires a separate Property Pages lookup for historical sales.
- **Lat/lon is never published as DOM data — only as Google Static-Maps URL query params.** Pattern: `markers=icon%3A...%7C{lat}%2C{lon}` (URL-encoded `|` and `,`). Regex `%7C(-?[0-9.]+)%2C(-?[0-9.]+)`. Present on Property Pages and the listing's "Map" embed; absent on off-market pages where the dwelling has no street-view coverage.
- **`window.__INITIAL_STATE__` / `__NEXT_DATA__` / `__APOLLO_STATE__` are NOT present.** REA's frontend is a custom "Argonaut" SPA with no hydration blob exposed on `window`. Don't try to `evaluate` for one — extract from the rendered body/HTML instead.
- **No `application/ld+json` structured data.** REA omits schema.org RealEstateListing markup. You cannot shortcut extraction via JSON-LD parsing. Markdown scraping is the path.
- **Address rendering quirk — h1 has no space between street and suburb.** The h1 reads literally `6 Stawell StreetRichmond, VIC 3121` — split on the suburb token or the comma, not on whitespace.
- **Apartment / unit slug prefix.** `5/19 River Street` becomes `unit-5-19-river-st-...` on the Property Pages route — not `5-19-river-st`. Without the `unit-` prefix REA serves the wrong dwelling (the houseside #5 instead of the unit-5 inside #19).
- **Off-market pages show estimated value but it's gated behind sign-in.** `## Property value` renders `realEstimate™ $X,XXX,XXX Sign in to unlock`. Don't try to log in (read-only rule); record `realEstimate` as `gated: true` and skip the numeric value.
- **`No history available` is a valid outcome.** Some addresses have never traded since REA started tracking sales. Emit `historical_sales: []` rather than failing.
- **Sold-listing detail pages link back to Property Pages via `[Property history](/property/{slug}/)`** — follow that link to get the slug rather than rebuilding it; REA's own slug computation is authoritative (handles unit prefixes, street-suffix edge cases like "The Boulevard" → `the-boulevard`).
- **Page-view counter ("429 page views") and Property ID are visible at the bottom of for-sale listings** — useful as stable IDs for deduping but not required for extraction.
- **Agent phone numbers are masked** to the first 7 digits + `...` (e.g. `0411863...`) unless the user clicks "Call". Don't click. Emit the masked string as `agent_phone_masked`.
- **"Indicative price" is mandatory in VIC** under the Statement of Information regulations — when the headline says "Contact Agent" or "Auction", look for the `Indicative price: $X - $Y` sub-line; that's the seller's stated range and is what most agents and buyers anchor to.
