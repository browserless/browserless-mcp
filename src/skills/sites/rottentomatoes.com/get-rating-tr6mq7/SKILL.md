# Rotten Tomatoes Title Rating

## Purpose

Given a Rotten Tomatoes title URL, RT slug (`m/<slug>` or `tv/<slug>` / `tv/<slug>/s<N>`), or free-form title reference (`"The Matrix"`, `"Severance season 2"`), return current Tomatometer (critic) score, Popcornmeter / Audience score, certified flags, vote counts, sample critic reviews, full cast & crew, synopsis, where-to-watch affiliates, and core title metadata as one structured JSON object. Read-only — never clicks "Want to See", "Rate", "Sign In", or any audience-rating control.

## When to Use

- Spot-checking a movie / TV show's current Tomatometer and Popcornmeter (the canonical "should I watch this?" lookup).
- Bulk extraction across a list of titles for a recommendation engine, watchlist enricher, or release-monitoring agent.
- Resolving a free-form title string ("Severance season 2", "the matrix 1999") to a canonical RT page + score.
- Comparing critics vs audience sentiment for the same title.
- Pulling per-season Tomatometer + Popcornmeter for TV (the series page only surfaces a series-wide _average_; per-season scores live on the season URL).

## Workflow

Rotten Tomatoes is server-rendered HTML — the score, cast, synopsis, where-to-watch, and even the top critic-review cards are all in the initial HTML response. Two embedded JSON blobs do the heavy lifting:

- `<script ... id="media-scorecard-json" ... type="application/json">` — Tomatometer + Popcornmeter, sentiment, certified flags, rating counts, average rating, banded count, **and** the `overlay.audienceVerified` / `overlay.criticsTop` subsets when present.
- `<script type="application/ld+json">` — schema.org `Movie` / `TVSeries` / `TVSeason` with `aggregateRating`, `actor[]`, `director[]`, `producer[]`, `genre[]`, `contentRating` (MPAA / TV rating), `dateCreated` (release date), `containsSeason[]` (for TV series), `partOfSeries` (for TV season), `numberOfSeasons`, `image` (poster), and canonical `url`.

A `browserless_agent` `goto` + `html` against the canonical URL returns 200 with all of this — no proxy required. **There is no public JSON API**; this skill is "static-HTML-as-API." Lead with the page fetch; retry with residential proxy only if Akamai ever starts blocking (never observed during converged iters).

### 1. Resolve the URL

Three input shapes feed one canonical URL:

**(a) Full Rotten Tomatoes URL** — use as-is, but normalize: RT 301-redirects some legacy slugs (e.g. `/m/the_matrix` → `/m/matrix`). A `browserless_agent` `goto` follows the 301 automatically (a raw same-page `fetch` would not), so read the final URL off the response and emit it as canonical.

**(b) Slug** (`m/the_matrix`, `tv/severance`, `tv/severance/s02`) — prepend `https://www.rottentomatoes.com/` and treat as case (a).

**(c) Free-form title** — hit the search results page:

```
GET https://www.rottentomatoes.com/search?search=<URL-encoded query>
```

The search page is also server-rendered. Each match is a `<search-page-media-row>` web component with **attributes** carrying the disambiguation signals:

```
release-year="1999"
start-year="" end-year=""           (TV: "2022" "2026")
cast="Keanu Reeves,Laurence Fishburne,Carrie-Anne Moss"
tomatometer-score="83"
tomatometer-is-certified="true"
tomatometer-sentiment="POSITIVE"
```

…with `<a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/matrix" data-qa="thumbnail-link">` carrying the canonical URL. Sections are split by `<search-page-result type="movie|tvSeries">`. The page also surfaces filter counts: `Movies (68) | TV Shows (11704)`. For a query like "Severance season 2", pick the TV-show result then construct the season URL `/tv/<slug>/sNN` (or take the slug from the `containsSeason[]` array on the series page).

If the query has a year token, prefer the row whose `release-year` matches. If a `season N` is in the query and the matched TV row has multiple seasons, fetch the series page first to read `containsSeason[].url` and pick the right `/sNN` URL.

### 2. Fetch the title page

```json
{ "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/matrix", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } }
{ "method": "html", "params": { "selector": "html" } }
// or /tv/severance, or /tv/severance/s02
```

The `html` command returns the full server-rendered HTML; run the regexes below against it (or fold the JSON-blob parsing into an `evaluate` and return only the projected object). **No proxy is required** — a plain `browserless_agent` call succeeds against these pages. Add `proxy: { proxy: "residential" }` only if a 403 / "Access Denied" surfaces (rare; Akamai is configured permissively for these pages).

### 3. Extract the scores

Match the scorecard JSON (note the multi-line attribute layout — `[\s\S]*?` between `<script` and `id="..."`):

```js
const re =
  /<script[\s\S]*?id="media-scorecard-json"[\s\S]*?>([\s\S]*?)<\/script>/;
const j = JSON.parse(html.match(re)[1]);
```

`j.criticsScore`:

- `score` (string `"83"`) → Tomatometer 0–100
- `sentiment` ∈ `"POSITIVE" | "NEGATIVE"` (missing for no-score)
- `certified: true` → `Certified Fresh` status
- `ratingCount` → number of critic reviews
- `averageRating` (string `"7.90"`) → average critic numerical rating out of 10
- `likedCount`, `notLikedCount` → fresh-vs-rotten review tally

`j.audienceScore`:

- `score` (string `"85"`) → Popcornmeter 0–100
- `sentiment` ∈ `"POSITIVE" | "NEGATIVE"` (missing for no-score)
- `certified: true` → audience-side "Verified Hot" tier (also signalled by `j.audienceScore.certifiedFresh === "certified"`)
- `scoreType` ∈ `"ALL" | "VERIFIED"` — which subset is the primary surface on this page
- `reviewCount` → exact audience rating count
- `bandedRatingCount` (string `"250,000+ Ratings"` / `"5,000+ Ratings"`) → display-friendly bucket
- `averageRating` (string `"3.6"`) → audience average out of 5
- `likedCount`, `notLikedCount` → liked-vs-disliked tally

`j.overlay` (the score-details popup payload — usually richer than the primary surface):

- `criticsAll` / `criticsTop` — full critic pool vs top-critics-only subset
- `audienceAll` / `audienceVerified` — full audience pool vs verified-purchasers subset (RT splits these; the primary `audienceScore` block mirrors whichever subset the page chose to highlight)
- `mediaType` ∈ `"Movie" | "TvSeries" | "TvSeason"` — definitive title-type signal

**Status string derivation** (RT uses these labels publicly; emit them in your output):

| Tomatometer (critic) | Condition                                                 |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Certified Fresh`    | `criticsScore.certified === true`                         |
| `Fresh`              | `criticsScore.sentiment === "POSITIVE"` and not certified |
| `Rotten`             | `criticsScore.sentiment === "NEGATIVE"`                   |
| `No score yet`       | `criticsScore.score` is undefined / `ratingCount === 0`   |

| Popcornmeter (audience) | Condition                                                                              |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Verified Hot`          | `audienceScore.certified === true` (or `audienceScore.certifiedFresh === "certified"`) |
| `Upright`               | `audienceScore.sentiment === "POSITIVE"` and not certified                             |
| `Spilled`               | `audienceScore.sentiment === "NEGATIVE"`                                               |
| `No score yet`          | `audienceScore.score` is undefined                                                     |

### 4. Extract title metadata (JSON-LD)

Match the JSON-LD block:

```js
const ldRe = /<script[^>]+application\/ld\+json[^>]*>([\s\S]*?)<\/script>/g;
```

Keys used:

- `@type` ∈ `"Movie" | "TVSeries" | "TVSeason"` — title type. (Note: `j.overlay.mediaType` in the scorecard says `"Movie" | "TvSeries" | "TvSeason"` — same info, different casing.)
- `name` — primary title
- `contentRating` — MPAA / TV rating (`"R"`, `"PG-13"`, `"TV-MA"`, …)
- `dateCreated` — release date (`"1999-03-31"`); series shows the original series start, season shows that season's premiere
- `genre[]` — list of strings
- `actor[]` — top-billed cast as `{name, sameAs (RT celebrity URL), image}`. **Character/role names are NOT in JSON-LD** — pull them from the cast section HTML (step 6).
- `director[]`, `producer[]` — names + RT URLs
- `image` — poster URL (full-res Flixster CDN)
- `description` — RT's SEO blurb; replace with `j.description` from the scorecard JSON for the proper synopsis body
- `numberOfSeasons` — TV series only
- `containsSeason[]` — TV series only; `[{@type:"TVSeason", name:"Season 1", url:"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/severance/s01"}, …]`. Use this to enumerate season URLs.
- `partOfSeries` — TV season only; `{@type:"TVSeries", name:"Severance", startDate:"2022-02-18", url:"…/tv/severance"}`. Use this to backlink the season to its parent.

### 5. Extract media-info (runtime / distributor / production / release / box office)

These live in the "Media Info" section as `<dt>` / `<dd>` pairs. Each item is wrapped as:

```html
<div class="category-wrap" data-qa="item">
  <dt class="key">… <rt-text … data-qa="item-label">Runtime</rt-text></dt>
  <dd data-qa="item-value-group">
    <rt-text data-qa="item-value">2h 16m</rt-text>
  </dd>
</div>
```

Pull label/value pairs with one regex sweep:

```js
const itemRe =
  /<rt-text[^>]+data-qa="item-label">([^<]+)<\/rt-text>[\s\S]*?<dd[^>]+data-qa="item-value-group">([\s\S]*?)<\/dd>/g;
```

…then strip nested tags from each value. Known labels (case-stable): `Runtime`, `Original Language`, `Release Date (Theaters)`, `Release Date (Streaming)`, `Rerelease Date (Theaters)`, `Distributor`, `Production Co`, `Sound Mix`, `Aspect Ratio`, `Box Office (Gross USA)`, `Most Popular at Home`. For TV: `Premiere Date`, `Network`, `Genre`, `Executive Producer`, etc.

### 6. Extract cast tiles (with character/role names)

Cast tiles in `data-qa="section:cast-and-crew"` carry name + role inline:

```html
<a href="/celebrity/keanu_reeves" data-qa="person-item">
  …
  <div slot="inset-text" aria-label='Keanu Reeves, Thomas "Neo" Anderson'>
    <p class="name" data-qa="person-name">Keanu Reeves</p>
    <p class="role" data-qa="person-role">Thomas &quot;Neo&quot; Anderson</p>
  </div>
</a>
```

Each tile is one of: a director, a writer, or a cast member with a character role. Pair `data-qa="person-name"` and `data-qa="person-role"` within the same `data-qa="person-item"` anchor.

### 7. Extract critic reviews

Top critic reviews are rendered as `<review-card-critic>` web components in the `data-qa="section:critics-reviews"` section. Each card has named slots:

```html
<review-card-critic
  approved-critic
  approved-publication
  top-critic
  top-publication
>
  <rt-link
    slot="name"
    href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critic/joe-morgenstern"
  >
    Joe Morgenstern
  </rt-link>
  <rt-text slot="publication"> Wall Street Journal </rt-text>
  <span slot="timestamp">07/13/2023</span>
  <div slot="rating">
    <score-icon-critics sentiment="POSITIVE"></score-icon-critics>
    <span>2.5/4</span>
  </div>
  <span slot="review"
    >Though The Matrix ultimately overdoses on gloom-and-doom grunge…</span
  >
  <rt-link slot="review-link" href="https://web.archive.org/web/…/lfilm598.htm"
    >Go to Full Review</rt-link
  >
</review-card-critic>
```

The card-level attributes are signal flags: `top-critic`, `top-publication`, `approved-critic`, `approved-publication`. Use them to weight the sample. About 10 cards render per title page; the full list is at `/m/<slug>/reviews` (or `/reviews/top-critics`) if a larger sample is required.

The critics' consensus blurb is at `id="critics-consensus" class="consensus"` as a single `<p>`.

### 8. Extract "Where to Watch" (streaming-available-on)

```js
const wtw = JSON.parse(
  html.match(/<script id="where-to-watch-json"[^>]*>([\s\S]*?)<\/script>/)[1],
);
// wtw.affiliates: [{icon:"fandango-at-home", url:"…", isSponsoredLink:false, text:"Fandango at Home"}, …]
// wtw.affiliatesText: "Rent The Matrix on Fandango at Home, or buy it on Fandango at Home."
// wtw.hasShowtimes, wtw.showtimesUrl — populated only for currently-in-theaters titles
```

### 9. (Optional) Audience review samples

A second JSON script (no `id`, but contains `"audienceScore"` + `"reviews":[…]` at the top level — ~6th `<script type="application/json">` on a typical page) holds the first ~5 audience reviews with `displayName`, `displayDate`, `rating` (out of 5), `review` body, and `isVerified` flag. Skip this unless explicitly requested — the task is critic-led.

### Browser fallback

Browser-driving is **not** required for any observed page state — the primary path above is already a real browser page. If a plain `browserless_agent` call ever starts returning 403, retry the same `goto` with residential proxy and read the hydrated DOM:

```json
{ "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/<slug>", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } }
{ "method": "html", "params": { "selector": "html" } }
```

Add `proxy: { proxy: "residential" }` at the top level of the call. The same JSON blobs render server-side into the live DOM — extract identically (or run the JSON-blob extraction in-page via an `evaluate`).

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **Slug redirects**: Several canonical-feeling slugs 301 to a shorter form — `/m/the_matrix` → `/m/matrix` is the textbook example. A `browserless_agent` `goto` **auto-follows** the 301 (a raw same-page `fetch` would not); read the final URL off the response and always emit the _final_ URL as the canonical one.
- **Multi-line script attributes break naïve regex**: The `<script id="media-scorecard-json" …>` tag is laid out across multiple lines on movie / TV-show pages (not minified). A regex like `/<script id="media-scorecard-json"[^>]*>/` _fails_ on these pages because `[^>]` does not match the newline-prefixed attribute layout. **Use** `/<script[\s\S]*?id="media-scorecard-json"[\s\S]*?>([\s\S]*?)<\/script>/`. Verified on `the_odyssey_2026` (pre-release) and `avatar_fire_and_ash` (released): single-line on some, multi-line on others, presumably depending on which Next.js page template hits.
- **TV series page shows _averaged_ scores, not the latest season**: On `/tv/<slug>` the scorecard `criticsScore.title` is `"Avg. Tomatometer"` and `audienceScore.title` is `"Avg. Popcornmeter"` — these are aggregates across all seasons. For a specific season's score, fetch `/tv/<slug>/sNN` and read the scorecard there (its `title` will be the unprefixed `"Tomatometer"` / `"Popcornmeter"`). When the user asks for "Severance ratings" without specifying a season, return both: the series average (with `is_average: true`) and the latest season (from `containsSeason[].url`).
- **`audienceScore` mirrors a chosen subset**: `audienceScore.scoreType` switches between `"ALL"` and `"VERIFIED"` per page. The page chooses which subset to display prominently — typically `"VERIFIED"` when verified ratings cross a threshold (Avatar 3: `VERIFIED` selected with 10,000+ verified ratings out of 25,000+ total). The full `overlay.audienceAll` and `overlay.audienceVerified` blocks are _always_ present when both exist — read both and emit both subsets in the output JSON, not just the primary surface.
- **`certified: true` means different things on each side**: On `criticsScore` it's the classic "Certified Fresh" (≥75 % score + 80 reviews including 5 top-critic reviews). On `audienceScore` it's the newer "Verified Hot" / "Certified Audience" tier (high verified-purchase rating). The field name is the same; the semantics aren't. Emit them as separate `tomatometer_status` and `audience_status` fields.
- **No score yet ≠ zero score**: A pre-release / under-reviewed title shows `criticsScore: {likedCount:0, notLikedCount:0, ratingCount:0, reviewCount:0, title:"Tomatometer"}` with **no** `score` / `sentiment` field. Don't coerce missing to `0` — emit `null` (or omit) and set status to `"No score yet"`. Same applies on the audience side (`reviewCount:0`, no `score`, `certifiedFresh:"none"`).
- **JSON-LD `actor[]` has no character names**: It only carries actor names + RT celebrity URLs + headshots. Cast roles ("Neo", "Morpheus", "Trinity") live in the HTML cast tiles under `<p class="role" data-qa="person-role">`. If your output schema needs role names, you must parse the HTML — JSON-LD alone is not enough.
- **JSON-LD `description` is SEO copy**: It reads `"Discover reviews, ratings, and trailers for The Matrix on Rotten Tomatoes…"` — meta-description fluff, not the actual synopsis. The real synopsis is `j.description` on the scorecard JSON (or `j.overlay` payload). Don't surface the LD `description` to users.
- **`dateCreated` semantics shift by title type**: For a `Movie` it's theatrical release. For a `TVSeries` it's the original series premiere (e.g. Severance: `2022-02-18`). For a `TVSeason` it's that season's premiere (Severance S2: `2025-01-17`). The HTML `Release Date (Theaters)` / `Premiere Date` media-info fields carry the same value in human-friendly form.
- **The page fetch does not require a proxy and is NOT rate-limited in normal usage**: verified across 7 consecutive fetches with no 403/429 from a default egress. The page-level Akamai config is permissive for read paths. Reserve residential proxy for genuine failure recovery; don't add it prophylactically (it's slower).
- **Search results are server-rendered web components, not JS-hydrated cards**: `<search-page-media-row>` attribute strings already contain the disambiguation signals (`release-year`, `cast`, `tomatometer-score`). You don't need a `snapshot` or JS-hydration step — the raw HTML attributes are enough to pick the right row.
- **Free-form search with multiple top hits**: A query like `"the matrix"` returns 68 movie matches and ~11,700 TV matches (reboots, parodies, indie titles using the word). Always disambiguate by `release-year` when the user gave a year, by media type when the user said "show" / "season" / "movie", or by cast intersection. If still ambiguous, return the top-3 candidates with their RT URLs and scores rather than guessing.
- **Some streaming affiliates are sponsored**: `wtw.affiliates[].isSponsoredLink === true` flags paid placements (often Fandango at Home for older titles RT still owns). The user-meaningful affiliates (Netflix / Max / Disney+ / etc.) are non-sponsored. Filter or annotate accordingly when emitting `streaming_available_on`.
- **READ-ONLY**: Never click `Want to See`, `Not Interested`, `Sign In`, the star-rating widgets in audience-review composer, or the `Submit your review` button. The skill purpose is observation only.
