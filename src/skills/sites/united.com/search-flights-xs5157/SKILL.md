      United's internal /api/flight/recentSearch returns 405 Method Not Allowed

# United Airlines Flight Search

## Purpose

Given an origin airport, destination airport, depart date (and optionally a return date), trip type (one-way or round-trip), and a passenger count, return the list of available United Airlines flights for those parameters — each flight's departure / arrival times, duration, stop count, flight number(s), cabin class, fare brand, and price. **Read-only — never click "Select", "Continue", or any seat / fare / book button. Stop at the results page (`/en/us/fsr/choose-flights`).**

## When to Use

- "What are the cheapest non-stops SFO → JFK on July 15?"
- "Compare one-way vs round-trip pricing on LAX → ORD next Friday."
- Daily price-watch across a fixed origin/destination/date.
- Any flow that needs UA's published fares + schedules **without** committing to a booking.
- Do **not** use this skill for award-mile / MileagePlus searches — those live on a different surface (`/ual/en/us/flight-search/book-a-flight/results`) and have a different fare model.

## Workflow

The United flight-search UI is a JavaScript SPA. The cleanest path is to **navigate directly to the search-results deep-link URL** (`/en/us/fsr/choose-flights?f=...&t=...&d=...&r=...&tt=...`) instead of filling the homepage's typeahead form — this skips airport autocomplete, date-picker, and trip-type radio entirely, and avoids the typeahead-timing bugs that the form path is prone to. The page is still client-side rendered, so a real browser session is required to harvest the flight cards; the URL is just a shortcut into the right page state.

A residential-proxy real browser is mandatory — the site is fronted by Akamai and a bare datacenter IP gets cookie / `_abck` challenges before any results render.

### 1. Residential-proxy session config

Every `browserless_agent` call must carry a top-level `proxy: { "proxy": "residential", "proxyCountry": "us" }` argument. Confirmed by response evidence: `_abck` and `bm_*` Akamai cookies are set on every response, and a bare-IP request gets a challenge page in place of the SPA shell.

There is **no session-create / release step**. A `browserless_agent` session persists across separate calls, keyed by the call's `proxy` config — repeat the same `proxy` arg on **every** call to reconnect to the same warmed browser (cookies and `_abck` clearance intact); dropping or changing it lands you in a different, challenge-walled session. Batching the full `goto → wait → snapshot` flow into **ONE** call's `commands` array is the convenient default — it saves round-trips and avoids accidentally dropping the session config.

A residential-proxy real browser clears Akamai's `_abck` challenge automatically. If a challenge / "verify you are a human" page still persists after the page renders, it is **terminal for that session** — abandon it and start a fresh `browserless_agent` call (a new ephemeral session).

### 2. Construct the deep-link URL

```
https://www.united.com/en/us/fsr/choose-flights
  ?f={ORIGIN_IATA}
  &t={DEST_IATA}
  &d={DEPART_YYYY-MM-DD}
  &r={RETURN_YYYY-MM-DD}          # omit for one-way
  &tt={1|0|2}                      # 1=round-trip, 0=one-way, 2=multi-city
  &sc=7                            # search-class — keep 7 for cash fares
  &px={PASSENGER_COUNT}            # integer, 1–9
  &taxng=1                         # show all-in (taxes included) pricing
  &clm=7                           # cabin: 7=Economy, 6=Premium Economy, 4=Business, 3=First
  &st=bestmatches                  # bestmatches | priceasc | departtime | arrivetime | duration
  &newDateOverride=true            # use new date logic — safer on cross-month dates
```

Examples (both validated as `200 OK` via a residential-proxy `goto` against the production host):

```
# Round-trip SFO → JFK, depart 2026-07-15, return 2026-07-22, 1 adult, Economy
https://www.united.com/en/us/fsr/choose-flights?f=SFO&t=JFK&d=2026-07-15&r=2026-07-22&tt=1&sc=7&px=1&taxng=1&clm=7&st=bestmatches

# One-way SFO → JFK, depart 2026-07-15, 1 adult, Economy
https://www.united.com/en/us/fsr/choose-flights?f=SFO&t=JFK&d=2026-07-15&tt=0&sc=7&px=1&taxng=1&clm=7&st=bestmatches
```

The URL accepts the airport as **IATA code only** (`SFO`, `JFK`, `LAX`, `ORD`, `EWR`, `LHR`, ...). City names, station IDs, or anything else gets coerced to a "no flights" state. If the caller hands you a city name, resolve it to an IATA code first (United's airport-lookup API at `/api/airports/lookup/search` returns `404` — not a usable surface — so resolve client-side from a static IATA table).

### 3. Open the URL and wait for cards to render

Run the goto → wait → snapshot as **one** `browserless_agent` call (proxy repeated):

```json
{
  "proxy": { "proxy": "residential", "proxyCountry": "us" },
  "commands": [
    {
      "method": "goto",
      "params": { "url": "<URL>", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 }
    },
    { "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 4000 } },
    { "method": "snapshot" }
  ]
}
```

Use `waitUntil: "load"` — **never** `networkidle` (it hangs on this SPA). The first paint of the results grid is **client-side**, so the `load` event alone is not sufficient; flight cards aren't in the DOM until the `searchFsr` XHR resolves. Empirically 3–4 seconds (the `waitForTimeout`) covers the long tail. If the snapshot returns 0 flight-card refs, issue a fresh call with an extra `waitForTimeout` of `2000` before the snapshot and retry once before declaring failure.

### 4. Branch on what the snapshot shows

| Snapshot signal                                               | Outcome                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| List of flight cards with depart/arrive times + price buttons | **success** — extract                                                                                                                |
| "We're unable to process your request" banner                 | **fail** — `error_reasoning: "site_error_banner"`                                                                                    |
| Captcha / "verify you are a human" / Akamai 403 page          | **fail** — `error_reasoning: "akamai_challenge"`. The challenge is terminal for that session; start a fresh `browserless_agent` call |
| "No flights available for the dates you selected"             | **success** with empty `results: []` and `no_flights_for_dates: true`                                                                |
| Date-picker overlay re-appearing                              | The `d=` or `r=` value was rejected. Confirm the date format is `YYYY-MM-DD` and that it's ≥ today                                   |
| Page header city ≠ requested route                            | The `f` / `t` codes were unrecognized — retry with verified IATA codes                                                               |

### 5. Extract flight cards

Each card on the results grid exposes:

- **Depart time** — first time string in the card (`08:30`, in the rendered local airport time).
- **Arrive time** — second time string.
- **Duration** — explicit text like `5h 35m` (or `5h 35m +1d` for next-day arrivals).
- **Stop count** — text like `Nonstop`, `1 stop`, `2 stops`. Parse to an integer.
- **Flight numbers** — text like `UA 232` (or `UA 232, UA 7411` on multi-leg). Capture the full list.
- **Cabin / fare options** — typically Basic Economy / Economy / Premium Plus / Business / First, with one price each. Capture the **lowest-cabin price** unless the caller specified a higher cabin via `clm`.
- **Price** — USD number, sometimes shown as `$348.20*` (the `*` indicates a Saver/award-mix fare — strip when emitting clean numbers, surface as `flags: ["saver"]`).

For round-trip, the page renders **outbound** cards first; after the user selects an outbound, **return** cards render on a follow-up screen. To stay read-only, extract **only the outbound** cards and emit them as `results`. If the caller wants return-leg pricing too, run a second one-way search with `f` / `t` swapped and `d=<return date>`.

### Form-fill fallback (only if the deep-link URL stops working)

If United changes the FSR URL schema and the deep-link returns the homepage redirect or a date-picker overlay on every load, fall back to driving the homepage form — keep the whole sequence inside one `browserless_agent` `commands` array (proxy still required):

1. `{ "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "https://www.united.com/", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } }`
2. Wait for the "Book travel" widget to mount: `{ "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 3000 } }`.
3. Click the trip-type radio (`{ "method": "click" }`): `One-way` or `Round-trip` (default is `Round-trip`).
4. Click the **From** field, type the IATA code (`SFO`) with `{ "method": "type", "params": { "selector": "...", "text": "SFO" } }`, wait `2000ms` for the typeahead dropdown, then click the first option matching the code. **`type` does NOT auto-submit** (unlike a fill-and-Enter), so the field stays open long enough for the typeahead to surface — the `click → type → waitForTimeout 2000 → click <suggestion>` sequence works cleanly. (An input helper that auto-presses Enter would submit the field before the typeahead surfaces — avoid it.)
5. Repeat step 4 for the **To** field.
6. Click the **Depart** date field; the date-picker overlay opens. Navigate to the target month with the `>` button, click the target day. For round-trip, the picker stays open; navigate + click the return day. Confirm with the picker's `Done` / `Apply` button.
7. (Optional) Update passenger count + cabin via the **Travelers** / **Cabin** dropdown.
8. Click `Find flights`. Page navigates to `/en/us/fsr/choose-flights?...` with the params URL-encoded. From here continue with the `waitForTimeout → snapshot` of the deep-link path (step 3).

Form-fill is ~3× slower than the deep-link path and adds two failure modes (typeahead-race, date-picker-month-overshoot), so use only when the deep-link is confirmed broken.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **READ-ONLY.** Never click `Select`, `Continue`, `Book`, `Add to cart`, or a fare-option price button — any of these starts the booking funnel and may hold inventory.
- **Akamai is on every path.** Both `/` and `/en/us/fsr/choose-flights?...` set `_abck`, `bm_ss`, `bm_s`, `bm_mi`, and `akacd_NS_AB` cookies on the first response. A datacenter-IP session will be challenged on the second navigation. A residential-proxy `browserless_agent` call (proxy repeated on every call) is the minimum viable config.
- **Pure SPA — no embedded results state.** A plain non-proxied fetch / `goto` of the deep-link returns the React shell HTML (~75 KB) with **zero** flight data embedded. There is no scraping shortcut that skips the browser; you must let the page hydrate. Verified by grepping the fetched body for `searchContext|fareFamily|cabinClass|currentSearchCriteria` — zero matches.
- **`/api/flight/recentSearch` returns `405 Method Not Allowed` to GET.** The endpoint exists internally but only accepts authenticated POSTs from the SPA's signed-session context. **Don't waste time trying to reverse-engineer United's internal `searchFsr` JSON endpoint** — it's behind anti-tamper headers + session cookies that aren't reproducible from an out-of-band fetch. Drive the browser instead.
- **`/api/airports/lookup/search` returns `404`.** The airport-typeahead endpoint is not at the obvious path. If you need IATA-code lookup, use a static IATA table (carry one in the skill harness) rather than trying to hit a United-side resolver.
- **Date format must be `YYYY-MM-DD`.** The URL parser accepts `2026-07-15`; anything else (`07/15/2026`, `15-Jul-2026`, ISO with timezone) silently drops back to the date-picker overlay.
- **`tt=1` is round-trip, `tt=0` is one-way, `tt=2` is multi-city.** Counter-intuitive direction. `tt=2` requires a different param layout (`f1`/`t1`/`d1`, `f2`/`t2`/`d2`, ...) and is out of scope for this skill.
- **Cross-month / past dates → date-picker re-opens.** If the date-picker overlay re-appears instead of cards rendering, the requested date was rejected. Common causes: date in the past, date > 11 months out (UA's booking window), or wrong format.
- **`taxng=1` is important.** Without it, the listed prices are base-fare-only (no taxes/fees), which gives misleadingly low quotes. Always include it for "what does this cost?" queries.
- **`*` on prices = Saver / mixed-cabin fare.** Strip the asterisk when emitting numeric prices; surface as `flags: ["saver"]`.
- **"No flights available" is a valid success.** Combinations like (very short window) + (small regional pair) + (high cabin class) frequently return an empty grid. Emit `success: true, results: [], no_flights_for_dates: true` — not a failure.
- **The deep-link can also accept `noflex=true`** to disable the flexible-date calendar above the grid (saves ~1s on hydration). Optional.
- **Award-mile pricing is on a different URL.** `/ual/en/us/flight-search/book-a-flight/results` is the award flow; do **not** confuse the two surfaces — they have different fare models, different cabin enums, and a different results DOM.
- **Round-trip cards only show outbound on the first page.** The return-leg grid only renders after an outbound is selected, which is a click this skill must NOT make. If both legs are needed, do two one-way searches and combine client-side.

// Success — no flights for the requested dates / cabin / route
{ "success": true, "results": [], "no_flights_for_dates": true, "error_reasoning": null, ... }

// Failure — Akamai challenge (challenge terminal, retry with a fresh residential-proxy browserless_agent call)
{ "success": false, "results": [], "error_reasoning": "akamai_challenge", ... }

// Failure — invalid input (unrecognized IATA, malformed date, past date)
{ "success": false, "results": [], "error_reasoning": "invalid_input: <field>=<value>", ... }

// Failure — site error banner ("We're unable to process your request")
{ "success": false, "results": [], "error_reasoning": "site_error_banner", ... }
```
