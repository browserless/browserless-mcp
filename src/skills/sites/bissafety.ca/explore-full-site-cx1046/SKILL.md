# BIS Safety — Full-Site Navigation

## Purpose

Systematically enumerate and traverse the entirety of `bissafety.ca` — every marketing page, blog post, and online safety course — and return a structured catalog of URLs (with titles, slugs, taxonomies, and last-modified timestamps) suitable for downstream indexing, link-validation, content-audit, or LLM-ingestion tasks. The site is a WordPress + Yoast SEO marketing/eLearning property; this skill is read-only and exercises the public REST + sitemap surfaces in preference to scripted browsing.

## When to Use

- Building a catalog of every BIS Safety course (~1,920 SKUs) for downstream search/comparison.
- Auditing the entire site for broken links, missing canonicals, or content gaps before a migration.
- Bulk-ingesting BIS Safety content (pages, blog posts, course descriptions) into a vector store or knowledge base.
- Generating a navigable site map for an agent that will later deep-link to specific course/page URLs.
- Verifying which URLs the site publicly indexes (e.g., before a robots.txt or noindex audit).
- Snapshotting the site structure on a recurring schedule for change-detection.

## Workflow

The site exposes its complete URL inventory through **two cheap, structured surfaces** — there is no reason to crawl HTML for navigation. Use the REST API + sitemap in tandem; reserve browser navigation for human-visible artifacts (screenshots, rendered hero copy with Elementor blocks, cookie-banner verification).

### 1. Enumerate URLs via Yoast sitemap index (one HTTP GET → all URLs)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bissafety.ca/sitemap_index.xml
```

Returns a sitemapindex pointing to four child sitemaps. As of the last verified run:

| Child sitemap                               | Purpose                              | URL count |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------- |
| `https://bissafety.ca/post-sitemap.xml`     | Blog posts                           | ~220      |
| `https://bissafety.ca/page-sitemap.xml`     | Marketing / product pages            | ~98       |
| `https://bissafety.ca/courses-sitemap.xml`  | Courses (part 1, max 1000 per Yoast) | 1000      |
| `https://bissafety.ca/courses-sitemap2.xml` | Courses (part 2)                     | ~913      |

Each child sitemap returns one `<url>` per page with `<loc>`, `<lastmod>`, and (for pages) inline `<image:image>` entries. Total enumerable inventory: **~2,238 URLs**.

Yoast emits sitemaps with `X-Robots-Tag: noindex, follow` — they're public but unindexed; you can still fetch them without auth or special headers.

### 2. Enrich each URL with structured metadata via the WordPress REST API

The `/wp-json/wp/v2/` namespace is fully open (no auth required). Custom post type `courses` is exposed at rest_base `courses`.

| Endpoint                                                                                           | What it returns                | Pagination | Total  |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------- | ------ |
| `GET /wp-json/wp/v2/pages?per_page=100&_fields=id,slug,link,title,date,modified`                   | Marketing pages                | 1 page     | ~98    |
| `GET /wp-json/wp/v2/posts?per_page=100&_fields=id,slug,link,title,date,modified,categories,tags`   | Blog posts                     | 3 pages    | ~220   |
| `GET /wp-json/wp/v2/courses?per_page=100&_fields=id,slug,link,title,date,modified,course-category` | Online safety courses (CPT)    | 20 pages   | ~1,920 |
| `GET /wp-json/wp/v2/course-category?per_page=100&_fields=id,slug,name,count`                       | Course taxonomy enum           | 1 page     | 8      |
| `GET /wp-json/wp/v2/categories?per_page=100`                                                       | Blog post taxonomy             | 1 page     | —      |
| `GET /wp-json/wp/v2/types`                                                                         | Post-type registry (discovery) | 1 page     | —      |

Always use `_fields=` to whittle the payload — the default response contains `content.rendered` (full HTML body, ~10–50 KB per item) and `yoast_head` (a meta-tag dump), which inflate transfer 10× and are rarely needed for navigation tasks.

Pagination contract: pass `page=N&per_page=100`. Response headers `X-WP-Total` and `X-WP-TotalPages` give the totals. Loop until `page > X-WP-TotalPages`.

The eight course categories (slugs are stable, agent can hardcode for filtering): `awareness` (700), `driver` (287), `electrical` (51), `equipment` (330), `products` (6), `safety` (1373), `soft-skills` (377), `virtual-reality-vr` (6). Counts overlap — a course can belong to multiple categories.

Recommended traversal sequence:

1. `GET /sitemap_index.xml` → list 4 child sitemap URLs.
2. Fetch each child sitemap in parallel → extract `<loc>` + `<lastmod>` per URL (regex `<loc>([^<]+)</loc>` works; full XML parse not required).
3. Bucket URLs by path prefix: `/courses/` → courses CPT, `/blog/` or `/{slug}/` matching a post → posts, all others → pages.
4. For each bucket, page through the matching `/wp-json/wp/v2/{rest_base}` endpoint with `per_page=100` + `_fields=` to enrich the URL list with `id`, `title.rendered`, `modified`, taxonomy IDs.
5. (Optional) Resolve `course-category` IDs against `/wp-json/wp/v2/course-category` once and inline names.

### 3. Optional: per-URL deep content fetch

If the task needs the rendered prose (e.g., for LLM ingestion):

- Prefer `/wp-json/wp/v2/{rest_base}/{id}?_fields=content,excerpt,title,slug,link` — clean HTML, no template chrome.
- Fall back to fetching the URL directly with `browserless_agent` (`goto` + `{ "method": "text", "params": { "selector": "body" } }`, or parse the DOM in an `evaluate`). The site serves a Cookie-banner overlay (Complianz/cmplz plugin) on first HTML render — it does **not** block the underlying DOM, so text extraction works without dismissing the banner.

### Browser fallback

If REST is ever disabled, blocked behind the Cloudflare bot check, or you need to verify visually-rendered Elementor content the REST API doesn't expose (some pages use Elementor's `_elementor_data` postmeta which is not in `content.rendered`):

1. Call `browserless_agent` with `proxy: { proxy: "residential" }` (the site is on Cloudflare + Kinsta + Nitro CDN; residential egress helps, a verified fingerprint is **not** required). Keep the whole crawl inside one call's `commands` array so the `__cf_bm` cookie persists across steps.
2. `{ "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "https://bissafety.ca", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } }` — the homepage's mega-menu exposes every product page in a single render. Site footer + `/all-courses/` listing covers the resource hubs.
3. Dismiss the cookie banner only if it overlays a critical hit target — a `text`/`snapshot` extraction works without it.
4. Crawl by following anchor `href`s (parse them inside an `evaluate`), deduplicating by canonical URL. The same-origin filter `https://bissafety.ca/` keeps the crawl bounded; explicitly drop `cdn-ilegmfm.nitrocdn.com` (the Nitro asset CDN — images and JS bundles, not HTML).

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **Use the sitemap, not the homepage navigation.** The header mega-menu surfaces ~60 product/resource URLs, but the site has **~2,238** total URLs. Skipping the sitemap and following anchors will undercount courses by ~97%.
- **Two course sitemaps, not one.** Yoast splits sitemaps at 1,000 URLs — both `courses-sitemap.xml` and `courses-sitemap2.xml` must be fetched. The sitemap_index lists both; do not stop at the first.
- **Old `/sitemap.xml` 301-redirects to `/sitemap_index.xml`** via Yoast SEO's redirect manager (`X-Redirect-By: Yoast SEO`). Either URL works, but follow the redirect (`curl -L`, or a `browserless_function` same-origin fetch, both honor it).
- **WP REST API is fully open** — no nonce, no key, no rate limit observed under residential-proxy traffic at ≤5 req/s. CORS is permissive (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin` not restricted), so the agent does not need to spoof Origin headers.
- **`per_page` max is 100.** Asking for more (e.g., `per_page=500`) returns a 400 `rest_invalid_param`. Use `page=N` to paginate.
- **Always pass `_fields=`.** Default REST payload includes the full rendered HTML body, `yoast_head` (~5 KB of meta tags per item), and `_links` (~2 KB HAL). Whittling to `id,slug,link,title,date,modified,course-category` cuts 1,920-course enumeration from ~80 MB to ~3 MB.
- **Course CPT taxonomy field is `course-category` (hyphen, not underscore).** The REST `_fields` selector and the filter parameter both use the hyphenated form: `?course-category=42` to filter by term ID, or `?course-category=safety` does **not** work — you must resolve the slug to an ID first via `/wp-json/wp/v2/course-category?slug=safety`.
- **Slug collisions across post types.** Several pages have `slug=lp` under different parents (`/company-spotlights/lp/`, `/ai-in-the-workplace/lp/`). Always key on `link` (full URL) or `id`, not `slug`, when deduping.
- **`__cf_bm` cookie** is set by Cloudflare on every response. Reusing a session that holds it materially speeds up subsequent fetches (drops latency from ~600 ms to ~120 ms by skipping bot-check); keeping the whole flow inside one `browserless_agent` (or `browserless_function`) call persists cookies automatically across its steps.
- **Nitro CDN cache (`X-Nitro-Cache: HIT`)** front-runs Kinsta. Pages refreshed minutes ago may still serve a stale `<lastmod>` in the sitemap until the Nitro purge fires — for monotonically fresh data, prefer the REST API's `modified` field over the sitemap's `<lastmod>`.
- **Cookie-consent banner (Complianz / `cmplz`) overlays the page** on the first HTML render but does not block underlying DOM access. a `text`/`html` extraction (or a `snapshot`) both see through it. There is no need to click "Accept" to extract content.
- **No GraphQL endpoint.** `/graphql` returns 404 — do not waste cycles on WPGraphQL-style queries.
- **Image CDN domain is different.** All assets serve from `cdn-ilegmfm.nitrocdn.com` (Nitro Pack). If you build a media inventory, dedupe by the original `bissafety.ca/wp-content/uploads/...` path that the CDN URL wraps.
- **Author archives, search, and feeds are disallowed in `robots.txt`** (`/author/`, `/search/`, `/feed/`, `/?s=`) — respect that boundary; they're explicitly excluded from "the entire site" surface for this skill.
- **Some Elementor pages embed content via `_elementor_data` postmeta** which the REST API does **not** include in `content.rendered`. Twelve to twenty pages (notably product landing pages built in Elementor Pro) will look near-empty via REST; for those, the browser fallback's `text`/markdown extraction is the source of truth.
- **`/wp-json/wp/v2/users` returns `401 rest_user_cannot_view`** for unauthenticated callers (good — author enumeration is blocked). Don't try to map post authors without credentials.
- **Recurring slug pattern `*-course-subscription` and `*-sitemap*.xml`** are the canonical anchor points for the subscription bundles and the sitemap surface, respectively. Useful for regex-bucketing.
