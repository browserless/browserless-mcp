# Mercari Search Listings — Browser Skill

## Purpose

Search Mercari (peer-to-peer US marketplace) for listings matching a free-form query, a fully-constructed search URL, an item-ID list, or a seller's shop URL — and return the matching items as structured JSON. Capture the page-wide result count, the active filter chips, and per-listing fields (item ID, title, price, condition, brand, size, color, seller, ratings, shipping payer, photo URLs, listing-age, "On Hold" / "Sold" status, Mercari Authenticate flag, like count, and canonical listing URL). Read-only — never click Buy Now, Make Offer, Add to Cart, Like, Follow, or Sign In.

## When to Use

- Snapshot a saved-search ("Lululemon Align leggings size 6, Like New, ≤$60, free shipping") on a recurring schedule.
- Comparison-shop a query across condition tiers / brand-authentication flags / sellers.
- Bulk-extract a seller's entire active inventory from `mercari.com/u/{sellerId}`.
- Hydrate an item-ID watchlist to current price + status.
- Anywhere you would otherwise scrape `mercari.com/search/` — this skill normalizes filter parameters and decodes the XHR response into a clean schema.

## Workflow

The Mercari search page is a Next.js SPA. `https://www.mercari.com/search/?keyword=...` returns a hydrated shell HTML with `__NEXT_DATA__.props.pageProps` populated only with Sentry trace metadata — there is **no SSR result data**. Results render from a client-side XHR to `https://www.mercari.com/v1/api/search` that requires session-bound auth (a cookieless `GET` returns `{"errors":[{"status":401,"message":"Unauthorized"}]}`; the SPA mints the required headers + cookies during the first navigation). The API surface that the public docs reference as "`/v2/entities/search`" on `api.mercari.com` is similarly auth-walled (500 / 401 on cookieless probes); the live web client uses `www.mercari.com/v1/api/search`.

The honest path is: **drive a real `browserless_agent` session with a residential proxy**, let the page mint its own auth state, then prefer the XHR JSON over DOM scraping. The browser path is mandatory — there is no useful cookieless API shortcut.

### 1. Residential-proxy session

Mercari sits behind Cloudflare (`cf-bm` bot-management cookie + `cf-ray` per response); a bare stealth session is fingerprinted as headless within the first navigation and gets either an Akamai-style block page or a stalled hydration with empty results. So every `browserless_agent` call for this skill MUST carry a top-level residential proxy:

```json
{
  "proxy": { "proxy": "residential" },
  "proxyCountry": "us",
  "commands": [/* goto → wait → extract, all in ONE call */]
}
```

**Repeat the `proxy` arg on every call** — the session is keyed by that `proxy` config, so repeating it reconnects you to the same warmed session (dropping or changing it lands you in a different, blank one). There is no separate session-create or session-release step; keep the whole flow (navigate → wait for hydration → capture the XHR / read the DOM → paginate) inside a single call's `commands` array so the Cloudflare cookies and hydration state persist. If a warm-up and the real navigation must be split, the second call still needs its own `proxy` arg (a dropped proxy lands you in a fresh logged-out/unverified session).

### 2. Translate the user input into a Mercari search URL

All inputs collapse to one canonical URL: `https://www.mercari.com/search/?{params}`.

**Input → URL mapping:**

| Input shape                                                         | URL strategy                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Full search URL (`https://www.mercari.com/search/?keyword=...&...`) | Use as-is.                                                                                      |
| Free-form keyword (`"PS5 controller"`)                              | `keyword=PS5%20controller`.                                                                     |
| Keyword + category (`"sneakers in Men's"`)                          | `keyword=sneakers&categoryId=2`.                                                                |
| Item-ID list (`m12345..., m23456...`)                               | Skip search; open each `https://www.mercari.com/us/item/{itemId}` individually (see step 6).    |
| Seller URL (`/u/{sellerId}`)                                        | Open `https://www.mercari.com/u/{sellerId}` and harvest the seller's listing grid (see step 7). |

**Filter-param surface** (URL params that map 1:1 to the in-page filter controls). All are optional; combine freely. Unknown params are silently ignored by Mercari, so the safe default is "emit only the params the user explicitly requested" — don't paint the URL with defaults that may shift the result set.

| Filter UI control    | URL param              | Values                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Brand filter is **category-aware**: a brand-ID returned under `categoryId=1` (Women) may not be valid under `categoryId=4` (Electronics) — re-discover the brand-ID list within the target category.                                                                                                                                                                                            |

The exact ID enums (categoryId subtree, brandId, colorId, sizeId) are **not stable across Mercari builds** and are not published in the page HTML. When the user expresses filters in plain English ("Like New only", "Nike, Adidas", "size M"), the recommended pattern is: **(a) open the search URL with only the keyword + category, (b) snapshot the filter sidebar, (c) read the visible label-to-ID mapping from the accessibility tree, (d) re-issue the URL with the resolved IDs**. The category sidebar always reflects the current build's enum, so this is self-correcting.

### 3. Open the search URL and wait for hydration

Inside the single call's `commands` array (with the `proxy` arg above):

```json
[
  {
    "method": "goto",
    "params": {
      "url": "https://www.mercari.com/search/?keyword=PS5%20controller&categoryId=4&itemConditions=1,2&priceMin=20&priceMax=80&sortBy=created_time",
      "waitUntil": "load",
      "timeout": 45000
    }
  },
  { "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 3000 } },
  {
    "method": "waitForSelector",
    "params": { "selector": "[data-testid='ItemContainer']", "timeout": 10000 }
  }
]
```

Never use `networkidle` — Mercari's SPA keeps connections open and it hangs. The result grid renders only after the `/v1/api/search` XHR returns; reading the DOM before the XHR completes returns an empty `<main>` skeleton. The `waitForSelector` on the listing-container test-id is the most reliable readiness signal — Mercari's loading-state placeholders use a different test-id (`SkeletonItem`), so it cannot false-positive into the skeleton view.

### 4. Prefer the XHR JSON over the DOM

There is no separate network-capture directory in Browserless. To grab the `/v1/api/search` response JSON directly, use `browserless_function` (same residential-proxy arg) and attach a response listener BEFORE navigating, then wait for the matching response — all in the same call so the session/cookies persist:

```js
// browserless_function
export default async ({ page }) => {
  const searchResp = page.waitForResponse(
    (r) => r.url().includes('/v1/api/search') && r.status() === 200,
    { timeout: 45000 },
  );
  await page.goto(
    'https://www.mercari.com/search/?keyword=PS5%20controller&categoryId=4&itemConditions=1,2&priceMin=20&priceMax=80&sortBy=created_time',
    { waitUntil: 'load', timeout: 45000 },
  );
  const json = await (await searchResp).json();
  // project/summarize in-page — do NOT return the raw multi-hundred-KB payload
  return { data: json, type: 'application/json' };
};
```

(If capturing the XHR proves flaky, fall back to `browserless_agent`: let the grid hydrate, then read the rendered DOM via `evaluate` — see step 5.) The captured `/v1/api/search` JSON (host `www.mercari.com`) is the source of truth for every per-listing field — title, current price (raw + formatted), condition, brand, size, color, seller (username + rating + review count + Pro/Top-Rated badge + verified flag), shipping payer + shipping cost + ship-from ZIP, Mercari Authenticate flag, item status (`on_sale` / `trading` / `sold_out`), like count, created/updated timestamps, photo URLs (primary + additional), and the `id` (e.g. `m12345678901`) that constructs the canonical URL `https://www.mercari.com/us/item/{id}/`.

The response shape (observed on cookieless probes that confirmed the endpoint exists, plus standard SPA hydration patterns):

```
{
  "meta":   { "numFound": <int>, "offset": <int>, "hasMore": <bool> },
  "data":   [ { /* per-listing fields */ } ],
  "facets": { /* mirror of active filter chips */ }
}
```

`meta.numFound` is the page-wide result count to surface in your output. `facets` mirrors the chips currently applied to the result set — useful for confirming the URL params resolved to the intended filters (especially after step 2's brand-ID / size-ID resolution).

### 5. DOM fallback (when XHR capture is unavailable)

If the network-capture file isn't populated (rare — happens when the page mints its data via a service worker rather than a top-level XHR), fall back to the rendered DOM. Each listing tile is a `<a>` wrapping an article with `data-testid="ItemContainer"`. Per-tile selectors:

- **Canonical URL**: the wrapping `<a>` href is `/us/item/{itemId}/`. Item ID is the path segment between `/item/` and the trailing slash.
- **Title**: `[data-testid='ItemTitle']` text.
- **Price (formatted)**: `[data-testid='ItemPrice']` text. Strip the `$` to get raw USD.
- **Primary image**: the tile `<img src>`. Additional images are not in the grid — they're on the item detail page.
- **Status pill**: presence of `data-testid='SoldBadge'` → `"sold_out"`; `data-testid='OnHoldBadge'` → `"trading"`; otherwise `"on_sale"`.
- **Mercari Authenticate badge**: presence of `[data-testid='AuthenticatedBadge']`.
- **Like count**: `[data-testid='LikeButton'] [aria-label*='Like']` text, when shown.
- **Listing-age**: `[data-testid='ItemListedAt']` — relative ("Listed 3 days ago"); absolute timestamps are in the XHR JSON only.
- **Price-drop badge**: `[data-testid='PriceDropBadge']` presence.

Seller-level fields (rating, review count, badges) and full size/color/condition labels are **not** in the grid tile — they live on the item detail page or in the XHR JSON. If the DOM-fallback path is in use and these fields are required, click through to each `/us/item/{itemId}/` and harvest from there. This costs ~1 turn per item; prefer fixing the XHR-capture path.

### 6. Item-ID hydration mode (input is a list of IDs, not a query)

For each `itemId` in the input list, open `https://www.mercari.com/us/item/{itemId}/`. The detail page hydrates from `https://www.mercari.com/v1/api/items/{itemId}` (also 401 cookieless — same browser-driven auth model). Capture it the same way as step 4: a `browserless_function` `waitForResponse` on `/v1/api/items/` around the `goto`, or `goto` + `waitForTimeout 2000` then read the hydrated DOM/`evaluate`. Do **not** click the photo carousel, Buy Now, Make Offer, or Like — read-only.

### 7. Seller-shop mode (input is `/u/{sellerId}`)

Open `https://www.mercari.com/u/{sellerId}` and treat the seller's active-listing grid the same as the search-results grid (same `ItemContainer` test-id, same per-tile selectors). The seller-level XHR is `https://www.mercari.com/v1/api/users/{sellerId}` and is captured alongside the grid hydration; merge the seller fields (rating, review count, badges, member-since date) into every per-listing record. Scroll to trigger infinite-scroll pagination — the seller grid uses scroll-based fetching, not offset-based.

### 8. No session-release step

There is nothing to release — and the session does **not** tear down when the call returns: it persists keyed by the call's `proxy` config, so a later call carrying the same `proxy` reconnects to it with the Cloudflare-minted cookies and auth state intact. A call that drops or changes the `proxy` lands in a different, blank session. Keeping the full search/hydrate/capture/paginate flow inside ONE call's `commands` array (each carrying the residential `proxy` arg) is the simplest way to avoid dropping that config mid-flow.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **READ-ONLY.** Never click Buy Now, Make Offer, Add to Cart, Like, Follow, or Sign In. The "Like" heart in particular is a single click that mutates seller-facing engagement signals — it is not a benign read action.
- **Cloudflare bot management + residential proxy are non-negotiable.** Every call needs the top-level `proxy: { proxy: "residential" }` (plus `proxyCountry: "us"`) arg; a bare stealth session is fingerprinted as headless within the first navigation and you'll see either a Cloudflare interstitial or a permanently empty result grid. If a Cloudflare challenge actually renders, add a `solve { type: "cloudflare" }` command before reading results. The `cf-bm` cookie that's set on the first response is part of the bot-score machinery — don't strip it.
- **`__NEXT_DATA__` on `/search/` is empty.** Confirmed: `props.pageProps` contains only `_sentryTraceData` + `_sentryBaggage`. Do not try to harvest results from the SSR HTML — there are none. You must let the page hydrate.
- **`/v1/api/search` requires session-bound auth.** Cookieless GET returns `{"errors":[{"status":401,"message":"Unauthorized"}]}`. The SPA mints the required tokens (likely a DPoP-style header + `cf-bm` cookie) during first navigation; you cannot reproduce this from a raw `curl` or a bare `browserless_function` fetch. Same for `/v1/api/items/{id}` and `/v1/api/users/{id}`. **Don't waste time trying to call these endpoints directly — confirmed blocked without a live browser session that has navigated the SPA first (capture the XHR via `waitForResponse` inside that same session instead).**
- **The `/v2/entities/search` endpoint on `api.mercari.com` is a trap.** Cookieless probes return 500. It is an internal GraphQL surface that the live web client no longer uses; the active SPA path is `www.mercari.com/v1/api/search`. Don't reverse-engineer GraphQL operations against `api.mercari.com`.
- **Filter-ID enums are not stable.** `categoryId` top-level integers (1–15) are stable, but every layer below — subcategoryId, brandId, colorId, sizeId — is build-versioned (current build at time of write: `r-v1.26.1613`). Always resolve plain-English filter inputs against the live filter sidebar in a probe navigation, not against a cached lookup table.
- **Brand filter is category-aware.** A `brandId` returned under `categoryId=1` (Women) may not exist under `categoryId=4` (Electronics). When a user asks for a brand without specifying a category, surface the brand-disambiguation back to the user rather than guessing.
- **Size filter is department-aware.** Letter sizes (XS, S, M, L, XL, XXL) in Women's apparel are different `sizeId`s from the same letters in Men's, Kids', or shoes. Always resolve `sizeId` after `categoryId` is locked in.
- **`__cf_bm` is the bot-management cookie — short TTL (~30 min).** A session held idle past the TTL gets new Cloudflare scrutiny on the next navigation. For long-running scrape loops, refresh by re-issuing the search URL every ~25 minutes; don't hold a stale tab.
- **`/us/item/m12345678901/` returns 404 for non-existent IDs**, but `/u/{anyString}/` returns 200 with an empty profile shell. When validating a seller-URL input, parse the rendered DOM for the username header — a missing header indicates a non-existent seller.
- **No public sitemap of listings.** `https://www.mercari.com/us-sitemap-index.xml` indexes only **category** and **brand-category** sitemaps (e.g. `/us/category/1/`, `/us/brand-category/{brandId}/{categoryId}/`). Individual item URLs are NOT in any sitemap — there is no fallback enumeration path if the search XHR is broken.
- **Hide-sold is the default.** The UI hides sold items by default; the URL param `status=sold_out` re-includes them. If the user is asking "did this item sell?", the answer is hidden in the default result set.
- **Scroll-loading on seller shops, offset-based on search.** Search results paginate via `offset=120, 240, ...`. Seller-shop grids use scroll-based infinite loading — the equivalent of offset is firing a scroll event near the bottom of the grid. Don't try to add `offset=` to a seller-shop URL; it's ignored.
- **`smartPricing` items drift.** Items with Smart Pricing enabled have a price that auto-reduces over time. A price captured at T+0 may be different at T+24h on the same itemId — re-hydrate before quoting back to users on watch-list flows.
- **Listing-age is relative-only in the grid.** "Listed 3 days ago" / "Listed 2 hours ago" are the grid's only timestamps. Absolute `created_time` / `updated_time` epoch integers are in the XHR JSON. Prefer XHR for any chronological diffing.

For item-ID hydration mode, return a top-level `items: [...]` array of the same per-listing shape (no `query` / `active_filters` / `result_count` keys). For seller-shop mode, add a top-level `seller: {...}` object with seller-level fields and a `listings: [...]` array. Always include `id` on every listing — it is the only stable cross-session join key.
