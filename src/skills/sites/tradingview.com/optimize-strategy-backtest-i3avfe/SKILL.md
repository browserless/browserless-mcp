# TradingView Strategy Backtest Optimizer

## Purpose

Drive the TradingView web chart end-to-end to iteratively optimize a Pine Script® strategy: open the Pine Editor, replace its contents with your strategy code, compile it onto the chart, read the Strategy Tester's backtest metrics, adjust the strategy's inputs, and repeat — searching for a parameter set that **minimizes Max Equity Drawdown** while **maximizing Net Return**. This is an agentic optimization loop, not a one-shot extraction: each iteration produces a (params → metrics) data point, and the agent does coordinate/grid search across the strategy's inputs to converge on the best risk-adjusted configuration.

**Read-only with respect to the user's account** (never Publish, never Save to the public library, never place a real Trade) — but it _does_ require an authenticated TradingView session, because compiling any custom script onto the chart is gated behind sign-in.

## When to Use

- "Backtest this Pine strategy on AAPL/BTCUSD/ES and tune it for the best return-to-drawdown ratio."
- "Find MA-length + stop-loss settings that keep max drawdown under X% while staying net-profitable."
- Sweeping a strategy's `input.*` parameters and recording Net Profit / Max Equity Drawdown for each combination.
- Any flow that needs Strategy Tester metrics for a custom script. (Built-in indicator screening is a different, lighter task.)

## Workflow

`recommended_method: browser`. There is **no public API, URL deep-link, or MCP** for the Pine Editor or Strategy Tester — the chart is a heavyweight canvas/WebSocket app and the only surface. A bare (no-proxy, no-stealth) remote session loads the chart fine; no anti-bot was encountered. The one hard precondition is **authentication** (see Gotchas — every "Add to chart" path triggers a sign-in wall for a guest).

### 0. Precondition: be logged in

Reuse an **authenticated Browserless session/profile** — a persisted/authenticated browser context (e.g. a Browserless profile, or a session that has already completed TradingView sign-in). A guest session can open the chart and the Pine Editor and paste code, but **cannot compile a script onto the chart** — see Gotchas. Without a logged-in context this task cannot reach a single backtest metric.

There is **no anti-bot** here (`proxies:false`) — do **not** add a proxy. And there's no session-release step — nothing to release, and the session isn't torn down on return; it persists across calls, keyed by the session's `profile`. Driving this whole flow — open chart → Pine Editor → paste → compile → read metrics — inside ONE authenticated call's `commands` array is a convenience that keeps round-trips down; a later call carrying the same authenticated `profile` reconnects to the same warmed, logged-in context with the added strategy intact, while dropping or changing it lands you in a different, logged-out session.

### 1. Open the chart

```json
{ "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "https://www.tradingview.com/chart/", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } },
{ "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 5000 } }
```

(The canvas keeps streaming; the `waitForTimeout` gives it a few seconds. Use `waitUntil: "load"`, never networkidle.)

Set the symbol/timeframe you want to backtest on _before_ adding the strategy (top-left symbol search + the interval button, e.g. `button: 1 day`). The Strategy Tester backtests against whatever symbol+interval is loaded.

### 2. Open the Pine Editor

The editor is a right-rail toggle, **not** a bottom-footer tab on the default layout. `snapshot` to find `button: Pine` (the right-side icon rail) and click it:

```json
{ "method": "snapshot" },
{ "method": "click", "params": { "selector": "<button: Pine>" } },
{ "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 3000 } }
```

The editor opens with a default `//@version=6 / indicator("My script") / plot(close)` stub. The editable area is a Monaco editor exposed as `textbox: Editor content;Press Alt+F1 for Accessibility Options.`

### 3. Replace the editor contents via clipboard paste (do NOT type)

`window.monaco` is **not** exposed on the page, so you cannot `setValue()` the model directly. Typing char-by-char corrupts code (Monaco auto-indents and auto-closes brackets). The reliable method is **clipboard paste**, which preserves indentation exactly (verified):

```json
{ "method": "evaluate", "params": { "content": "navigator.clipboard.writeText(atob('<BASE64_PINE>')).then(()=>'ok')" } },
{ "method": "click", "params": { "selector": "<textbox: Editor content>" } },
{ "method": "press", "params": { "key": "ControlOrMeta+a" } },
{ "method": "press", "params": { "key": "ControlOrMeta+v" } },
{ "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 1000 } }
```

(`<BASE64_PINE>` = your Pine source base64-encoded — base64 dodges escaping/quoting hell in the `content` string. The `evaluate` puts it on the clipboard; the click focuses the editor, then select-all + paste.)

Your script **must declare `strategy(...)`, not `indicator(...)`** — only `strategy` scripts produce Strategy Tester output. A solid optimizable baseline:

```pine
//@version=6
strategy("DD-Opt MA Cross", overlay=true, initial_capital=10000, default_qty_type=strategy.percent_of_equity, default_qty_value=100, commission_type=strategy.commission.percent, commission_value=0.05)
fastLen  = input.int(20, "Fast MA")
slowLen  = input.int(50, "Slow MA")
stopPerc = input.float(5.0, "Stop Loss %") / 100.0
fast = ta.sma(close, fastLen)
slow = ta.sma(close, slowLen)
if ta.crossover(fast, slow)
    strategy.entry("Long", strategy.long)
if ta.crossunder(fast, slow)
    strategy.close("Long")
strategy.exit("SL", "Long", stop=strategy.position_avg_price * (1.0 - stopPerc))
```

Exposing your tuning levers as `input.*` is what enables the fast loop in step 6.

### 4. Compile onto the chart

```json
{ "method": "snapshot" },
{ "method": "click", "params": { "selector": "<button: Add to chart>" } },
{ "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 4000 } }
```

(Locate `button: Add to chart` in the snapshot; or press `ControlOrMeta+Enter` via `{ "method": "press", "params": { "key": "ControlOrMeta+Enter" } }`.)

If a compile error exists, the editor's bottom console shows a red error line — read it, fix the source, re-paste (step 3), re-add. **If you are not logged in, this is where a "Sign in" modal appears instead** (Google/Email). Authenticate, then retry.

### 5. Read the Strategy Tester metrics

Once a strategy is on the chart, a **Strategy Tester** panel/footer-tab appears. Open it and read the Overview tab. The metrics that matter for this task:

- **Net Profit / Total P&L** (absolute and % of initial capital) → the "high net return" objective.
- **Max Equity Drawdown** (labeled "Max Drawdown" / "Max equity drawdown", absolute and %) → the "low drawdown" objective.
- Supporting: Total Closed Trades, Percent Profitable, Profit Factor.

Extract with `{ "method": "text", "params": { "selector": "body" } }` (or scope the selector to the tester panel) and parse the labeled numbers. Screenshot the Overview for the record.

### 6. Optimize: adjust → re-run → keep the best

Define a single scalar objective so the search is well-posed. Recommended: **return-to-drawdown ratio = Net Profit % ÷ Max Equity Drawdown %** (maximize), optionally with a hard constraint like "Max DD% ≤ 20". Then do coordinate/grid search over the inputs:

1. Pick one input to vary (e.g. `Stop Loss %`).
2. **Change it via the chart's Inputs dialog, not by re-editing code** — far faster: click the strategy name in the chart legend → gear/Settings → **Inputs** tab → change the value → OK. The backtest re-runs automatically. (Re-pasting code in the editor also works but re-compiles the whole script.)
3. Re-read step 5's metrics; record `(params, net_profit_pct, max_dd_pct, ratio)`.
4. Move to the next value / next input. Keep the best-scoring configuration.

Effective levers for **lowering Max Equity Drawdown** without killing return:

- **Tighten the stop-loss** (`stopPerc`) — directly caps per-trade loss; the single biggest DD lever.
- **Add a trend filter** (e.g. only go long when `close > ta.sma(close, 200)`) — cuts counter-trend whipsaw losses.
- **Reduce position size** (`default_qty_value` < 100% of equity) — scales DD down proportionally.
- **Add a take-profit / ATR-based trailing stop** to lock gains.
- **Widen/narrow MA lengths** — longer slow MA = fewer, higher-conviction trades = usually lower DD but lower trade count.

Stop when the objective plateaus across a full pass of input changes. **Guard against overfitting**: validate the winning params on a second symbol or timeframe before reporting; report that the result is in-sample if you didn't.

### 7. Release

No explicit release step — nothing to release, and the session isn't torn down on return; it persists across calls keyed by the `profile`. (Keeping the optimization loop inside that one authenticated call keeps round-trips down; a later call carrying the same authenticated `profile` reconnects to the same warmed context with the added strategy and login intact — dropping or changing the `profile` lands you in a different, logged-out session.)

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **AUTH IS A HARD GATE on "Add to chart".** Verified in this build run on a guest session: both the **Add to chart** button and the **Ctrl/Cmd+Enter** shortcut immediately raise a TradingView "Sign in" modal (Continue with Google / Email). A guest can open the chart, open the Pine Editor, and paste/edit code, but **cannot compile a script onto the chart and therefore cannot reach a single Strategy Tester metric.** This task requires a pre-authenticated session. _(Everything from step 4 onward was documented from TradingView product behavior and not exercised in the build run, because no account was available — verify exact metric label strings on your first authenticated run.)_
- **No anti-bot on the chart itself.** A plain `browserless_agent` session (no proxy) loaded `https://www.tradingview.com/chart/` cleanly and ran the editor — `verified:false, proxies:false`. Do not add a proxy. The homepage 301-redirects to `www`; open `www.tradingview.com/chart/` directly.
- **`window.monaco` is undefined.** The Pine Editor is Monaco-based but the global is not exposed, so you cannot `monaco.editor.getModels()[0].setValue(code)`. Use clipboard paste.
- **Never type code char-by-char.** Monaco auto-indents and auto-inserts closing brackets/quotes; typing a multi-line script mangles it. **Clipboard paste (`Ctrl+A` then `Ctrl+V`) preserves indentation exactly** — verified, the pasted 15-line script kept its `if`-body indentation. `navigator.clipboard.writeText()` works inside Browserless sessions (clipboard read/write permission is granted).
- **The Pine Editor is a right-rail toggle, not a bottom footer tab** on the default chart layout. Look for `button: Pine` in the right icon rail. (The bottom footer only exposes `Screeners`/`Pine` shortcut buttons.) The **Strategy Tester** tab only materializes _after_ a strategy is successfully added to the chart.
- **`strategy(...)` vs `indicator(...)`.** The default editor stub is an `indicator`, which produces NO backtest. Your script must declare `strategy(...)` or the Strategy Tester stays empty.
- **Set symbol + interval BEFORE adding the strategy.** The backtest runs against the currently loaded symbol/timeframe; changing them after re-runs the test (good for cross-validation, but be deliberate).
- **Prefer the Inputs dialog over code edits for the optimization loop.** Re-pasting code recompiles the whole script; changing `input.*` values via the chart legend → Settings → Inputs re-runs the backtest much faster. This is why your tuning levers should be `input.*` parameters.
- **Free-tier backtest depth is limited** (bars available depend on plan; "Deep Backtesting" is a paid feature). Net Profit / Max DD are computed only over the visible/available history — keep the symbol+interval fixed across an optimization pass so comparisons are apples-to-apples.
- **Don't Publish or Save.** "Publish script" pushes to the public library and "Save script" writes to the user's account — neither is needed to backtest. Stay read-only.
- **Metric label naming has drifted.** Older UI: "Net Profit" / "Max Drawdown"; newer Overview: "Total P&L" / "Max equity drawdown". Match on the substring, not an exact string, and capture both the absolute and the `%` value.
