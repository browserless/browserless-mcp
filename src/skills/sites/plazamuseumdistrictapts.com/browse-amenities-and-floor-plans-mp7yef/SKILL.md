  - method: fetch
    rationale: >-
      The /amenities/ and /neighborhood/ pages are fully server-rendered static
      HTML — a single a residential-proxy HTTP fetch returns the complete
      amenity bullet lists and neighborhood POIs with zero JS. Use fetch for
      these two halves.
  - method: browser
    rationale: >-
      The /floorplans/ catalog is rendered client-side by the Jonah Digital
      floor-plan widget, which pulls live pricing/availability from a
      session-bound AJAX endpoint (_fp-renderable). That endpoint 302-redirects
      without the page's PHPSESSID cookie + per-session instance hash + XHR
      headers, so it is NOT replayable out-of-band. A rendered browser session
      is required for floor-plan pricing & availability.
  - method: browser
    rationale: >-
      The home address, embedded JSON-LD accommodationFloorPlan list (all 12
      layout names + detail URLs), and the dynamically-injected phone number are
      all present in the rendered DOM, giving the full 12-layout roster even
      though only currently-available layouts show pricing.

# Plaza Museum District — Amenities & Floor Plans

## Purpose

Extract a complete, read-only summary of **The Plaza Museum District** apartments (1615 Hermann Dr, Houston, TX 77004) — a Berkshire-managed, Jonah-Digital-built marketing site. Returns three things:

1. **Building (community + in-apartment) amenities** — the full feature lists.
2. **Neighborhood amenities** — nearby restaurants, coffee, shopping, recreation, plus the Walk Score.
3. **Floor plans** — the full 12-layout catalog (A1–A6l, D1–D6) with bed/bath/square-feet metadata, starting/per-unit base rent, lease terms, move-in dates, and live availability.

The optimal path is **hybrid**: the `/amenities/` and `/neighborhood/` pages are static server-rendered HTML you can grab with a single proxied `fetch`, while the `/floorplans/` page is a client-side widget whose live pricing/availability requires a rendered browser session. Nothing here is a purchase or booking flow — never submit the tour/apply forms.

## When to Use

- "What amenities does The Plaza Museum District offer (in-unit and community)?"
- "What's near the building — restaurants, shopping, walkability?"
- "List Plaza Museum District floor plans with prices, square footage, and what's available."
- A rental-aggregator or relocation agent collecting current availability + starting rents for one property.

## Workflow

### Part A — Amenities & neighborhood (cheap `fetch`, no browser)

Both pages are fully server-rendered — no client-side widget, so parse them in-page. Run one `browserless_agent` call per page: `goto` then an `evaluate` that strips tags and projects the bullet text. A residential proxy is the verified-working config (a proxy-less load also returns 200):

```jsonc
// browserless_agent — amenities (repeat for /neighborhood/ swapping the url)
{
  "proxy": { "proxy": "residential", "proxyCountry": "us" },
  "commands": [
    {
      "method": "goto",
      "params": {
        "url": "https://plazamuseumdistrictapts.com/amenities/",
        "waitUntil": "load",
        "timeout": 45000,
      },
    },
    {
      "method": "evaluate",
      "params": {
        "content": "(()=>{const grab=h=>{const el=[...document.querySelectorAll('h2,h3')].find(n=>n.textContent.trim().startsWith(h));if(!el)return[];const items=[];let n=el.parentElement;return [...document.querySelectorAll('li,.amenity')].map(x=>x.textContent.trim()).filter(Boolean);};return JSON.stringify({apartment:[...document.querySelectorAll('li')].map(x=>x.textContent.trim()).filter(Boolean)});})()",
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

Both `/amenities/` and `/neighborhood/` are static HTML, so a raw same-origin HTTP fetch would also work; the `browserless_agent` `goto` + `evaluate` path above is cleaner because it parses in-page instead of shipping raw HTML.

- **Amenities** live under two headings: **"Your Apartment"** (in-unit features) and **"Your Community"** (building/community features). Items flagged with a trailing `*` are "Available in select units." There is a "Show All" toggle in the DOM, but all items are already present in the static HTML — no expansion click needed.
- **Neighborhood** lists POIs grouped into four tabs — **Restaurants, Coffee, Shopping, Recreation** — plus a **Walk Score** ("71 — Very Walkable"). All four groups are present in the static HTML regardless of which tab is visually active.

Strip tags and read the bullet text. (Both pages also share a `/p/pet-friendly/` pet policy block: up to 2 pets, $400 fee/pet, $35/mo rent/pet, breed restrictions.)

### Part B — Floor plans (browser render required)

The `/floorplans/` page boots the Jonah Digital floor-plan widget (`/fp-assets/js/app.js`). Cards are injected client-side from a **session-bound** AJAX endpoint, so you must render the page in a real browser. Run the whole flow — nav → wait → surface the Floorplans tab → read text → grab the JSON-LD roster — inside **one** `browserless_agent` call so the `PHPSESSID` cookie + widget instance are established and used without round-trips (the session persists across calls, keyed by `proxy`, so repeating the same `proxy` reconnects to it; there is no separate release step — nothing to release). No stealth needed — a residential proxy is verified across this run.

```jsonc
// ONE browserless_agent call — session persists across calls (keyed by proxy); no release step
{
  "proxy": { "proxy": "residential", "proxyCountry": "us" },
  "commands": [
    // 1. Open. The load event may not fire because of long-tail trackers — that's
    //    harmless (content paints first). Fall through to a fixed wait rather than
    //    depending on the load event.
    {
      "method": "goto",
      "params": {
        "url": "https://plazamuseumdistrictapts.com/floorplans/",
        "waitUntil": "load",
        "timeout": 45000,
      },
    },
    { "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 5000 } },

    // 2. The widget has two tabs: `Map` (default — sightmap + a "List View" of every
    //    currently-available *unit*) and `Floorplans` (a grid of *layout types* with
    //    starting rent). Click the Floorplans tab to also surface the per-layout
    //    starting-rent cards. Confirm the tab selector via `snapshot` if the click misses.
    {
      "method": "click",
      "params": {
        "selector": "[data-tab='floorplans'], a:has-text('Floorplans'), button:has-text('Floorplans')",
      },
    },
    { "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 3500 } },

    // 3. Read the body — now contains BOTH the unit list and the layout grid.
    { "method": "text", "params": { "selector": "body" } },

    // 4. Grab the embedded JSON-LD for the full 12-layout roster (all names +
    //    /floorplans/{slug}/ detail URLs), even layouts with no current availability.
    {
      "method": "evaluate",
      "params": {
        "content": "JSON.stringify([...document.querySelectorAll('script[type=\"application/ld+json\"]')].map(s=>s.textContent))",
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

Parse what comes back:

- **Layout cards** (Floorplans tab, in the `text` result): `<PlanCode>` + `N bed N bath NNN sq. ft.` + `Base Rent $X,XXX` + optional `Only N left!` scarcity badge.
- **Unit cards** (Map tab "List View", in the `text` result): `<PlanCode>` + `#<unit>` + `Available <Mon DD>` + `N bed N bath NNN sq. ft.` + `Base Rent $X,XXX` + `NN months` lease term.
- **12-layout roster** (from the `evaluate` `.value` — a schema.org `ApartmentComplex` block whose `accommodationFloorPlan` array lists all 12 layout names with `/floorplans/{slug}/` detail URLs). 1-bedroom A-types: `A1, A2, A3, A4l, A5, A6l` · 2-bedroom D-types: `D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6`.

If `snapshot` is needed to locate the Floorplans tab ref, add a `{ "method": "snapshot" }` before the click in the same commands array and read the tab's selector from the a11y tree.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **READ-ONLY.** Stop at the floor-plan / availability screen. Never submit the "Schedule a Tour", "Find Your Home", or "Apply Now" (securecafe.com online leasing) forms. The site uses **reCAPTCHA v3** — a passive, hidden-badge token that only matters on form submit; it does **not** block page loads or floor-plan rendering. No CAPTCHA challenge, no Akamai, no login wall was hit anywhere (0 × 4xx across the run).
- **`fetch` works for amenities/neighborhood but NOT floor plans.** `/amenities/` and `/neighborhood/` are static and fully fetchable. `/floorplans/` returns only an empty widget shell on a plain fetch.
- **The floor-plan data endpoint is session-bound — do not try to replay it.** The widget calls `GET /floorplans/_fp-renderable/params:instance=<hash>&action=render&type=listing-chunks/?forcecache=1`. The `<hash>` (e.g. `20f4d721…`) is minted per session and tied to the `PHPSESSID` cookie; calling the endpoint (any variant, with/without proxies) without that live session + XHR headers **302-redirects to `/floorplans/`** with an empty body. Confirmed across multiple out-of-band attempts. Render the page instead.
- **"twelve distinct layouts" but only ~7 show pricing.** The widget only renders layout/unit cards for floor plans that currently have available units. At capture time the **Floorplans** tab showed 7 layout types (A1, A2, A3, A5, D1, D2, D6); the other 5 layouts (A4l, A6l, D3, D4, D5) appear only in the JSON-LD roster + have `/floorplans/{slug}/` detail pages, with **no live price/availability**. To report bed/bath/sqft for an unavailable layout, open its detail page; expect it to lack a current rent.
- **The embedded JSON-LD per-unit numeric fields are a BROKEN scaffold — do not trust them.** Every `accommodationFloorPlan` _unit_ entry repeats `numberOfBedrooms:1, numberOfBathroomsTotal:1, floorSize.value:686` regardless of the real layout (the D2 1175-sqft 2BR unit is mislabeled as 1BR/686). **The rendered card text ("2 bed 2 bath 1175 sq. ft.") is authoritative**; the JSON-LD is reliable only for the 12 layout _names_ and detail URLs.
- **"Outside price filter range" badge is noise.** Every unit in the Map-tab List View was tagged "Outside price filter range" even when its base rent ($1,629–$2,288) sits inside the default filter window ($1,600–$2,600). The widget's default price slider compares against a different (likely market/effective) price field, so this badge does **not** mean the unit is excluded. Ignore it; report the unit.
- **Sightmap floor-level "avail" counts don't reconcile with the unit list.** The Map tab's floor selector showed Floor 1 = 7, Floor 2 = 3, Floor 3 = 5, Floors 4–6 = 0 avail (sum 15), while "List View" said **7 available** and listed 7 units. Treat the per-unit List View as the authoritative availability count; the floor-selector tallies (Engrain/sightmap embed, asset_id 28411) are supplementary and can diverge.
- **The load event doesn't settle (~30s) on this site** because of long-lived third-party trackers (MeetElise/EliseAI chat, CallRail, GTM). The content paints well before that. Add a `waitForTimeout` of 4–5s after `goto` instead of relying on the load event.
- **No separate trace/capture step needed.** `browserless_agent` drives the page directly; there is no CDP-tracer attachment to sequence or misconfigure. Batch the `goto` → `waitForTimeout` → `evaluate`/`text` steps in one call's `commands` array.
- **Dynamic phone number.** The footer/header phone is swapped by a `GET /get-dni-phone-number/?format=dash` call (CallRail DNI), so you may see `(713) 597-7732` in the rendered DOM vs `(713) 874-1311` in the raw HTML. Both reach the property.
- **Data is live & changes.** Prices, lease terms, move-in dates, and which layouts are available are pulled fresh each load — re-render for current values rather than caching.

Notes for the consuming agent:

- `beds`/`baths`/`sqft` on `availableUnits` come from the **rendered card text**, NOT the JSON-LD (which is bugged — see gotchas).
- `startingRent` on a layout is the lowest base rent across its available units; per-unit rent varies (see `availableUnits[].baseRent`).
- `unavailableLayouts` have detail pages but no live pricing at capture time; fetch `detailUrl` (e.g. `/floorplans/d3/`) for their static bed/bath/sqft if needed.
- All rent values are USD/month base rent; lease terms in months.
