# Costco Same-Day — Build a Cart from a Grocery List

## Purpose

Given a list of grocery items, find the best-matching Costco Same-Day (Instacart-powered) product for each item and add it to the cart, biasing toward previously purchased products when a logged-in "Buy It Again" history is available. Returns, per item, the product chosen (name + price) and whether it came from purchase history, plus the running cart count. This skill is **write-to-cart but read-only past that** — it stops at the cart and never proceeds to checkout, payment, or order placement.

## When to Use

- "Add organic milk, large eggs, and bananas to my Costco Same-Day cart."
- Reorder/restock flows where a user wants their usual groceries queued for delivery.
- Converting a meal-plan or shopping-list into a ready-to-review Costco cart.
- Any flow that needs products selected and added — but **not** purchased.

## Workflow

The recommended method is **browser** driving the public storefront. Costco Same-Day is an Instacart white-label storefront; its internal product/cart APIs are session-token-gated and not usable cookieless, so the rendered storefront is the reliable surface. A **bare remote session is sufficient** — no residential proxy or stealth/verified browser was needed (homepage anti-bot probe: none detected; a plain `` run completed the full add-to-cart flow cleanly).

**Two distinct capability tiers — know which one you're in:**

- **Guest (no credentials):** search + add-to-cart fully work. The previously-purchased bias is **NOT** available — the "Buy It Again" page is empty for guests. Fall back to relevance search for every item.
- **Logged in (Costco.com SSO):** the "Buy It Again" page is populated with order history, enabling the previously-purchased bias. Sign-in is delegated to Costco.com and requires real member credentials; an automated agent without them cannot complete it — treat it as an auth wall and proceed as a guest.

### Steps

Keep steps 1–7 inside ONE `browserless_agent` call's `commands` array — the guest/session context must be set in the same session or the storefront 302s back to the landing page (see gotcha). The session persists across calls (keyed by the call's `proxy`/`profile` config), so batching is a convenience that saves round-trips and avoids accidentally dropping that config on a follow-up call and landing in a different, blank session; there is no session-release step.

1. **Open the entry page.** `{ "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "https://sameday.costco.com/", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } }`, then `{ "method": "snapshot" }`. The page offers two buttons: `Sign in via Costco.com` and `Browse as a guest`.
   - If you have valid Costco member credentials and need the purchase-history bias, load the `autonomous-login` skill (via `browserless_skill`) and follow its gates through the Costco.com SSO. Otherwise `{ "method": "click", "params": { "selector": "..." } }` on **`Browse as a guest`** (resolve its selector from the `snapshot`).
   - `{ "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 10000 } }` (the transition takes ~10s).

2. **Land on the storefront.** You arrive at `https://sameday.costco.com/store/costco/storefront`. The delivery ZIP is auto-set from the session's IP (e.g. `97818`) and the cart starts at 0. The header shows a `View Cart. Items in cart: N` button — this N is your source of truth for confirming adds.

3. **Check previously-purchased (the bias step).** Add a `goto` to `https://sameday.costco.com/store/costco/buy_it_again`.
   - **Logged in:** this lists products from the member's order history. For any grocery-list item that matches an item here, prefer that product (set `from_previously_purchased: true`).
   - **Guest:** the page shows "Reordering is a breeze / Items you order from this store will show up here" — i.e. empty. Record `previously_purchased_available: false` and fall back to search for every item.

4. **Search each item.** For each list entry, `goto` the search URL directly (no need to type in the box):

   ```
   https://sameday.costco.com/store/costco/s?k=<URL-encoded query>
   ```

   Then `{ "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 3000 } }` (results render 1–3s after load), then `{ "method": "snapshot" }`.

5. **Pick the best match.** Each result is a `group: Product` node containing:
   - a `heading` with the full product name,
   - a `StaticText: Current price: $X.XX`,
   - a sibling `button: Add 1 ct <product name>`.

   Choose the first result that genuinely matches the requested item. Prefer Kirkland Signature and the size/variant closest to the request (e.g. "organic milk" → an organic whole/2% milk multi-pack, not almond/soy unless asked). Costco sells in bulk multi-packs — there is rarely a single-unit option.

6. **Add to cart.** `click` the item's `Add 1 ct ...` button. It morphs into Decrement/Increment controls, and the header `View Cart. Items in cart: N` increments by 1. `{ "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 2000 } }`, `snapshot`, and **verify N increased** before moving to the next item.

7. **Confirm and emit.** After all items, read the final cart count and confirm it equals the number of items successfully added. Emit the JSON in Expected Output. **Stop here — do not open the cart's checkout flow.**

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **WRITE-TO-CART, NOT CHECKOUT.** Add items and stop. Never click through to checkout, payment, scheduling, or "Place order."
- **Previously-purchased bias requires login.** The "Buy It Again" page (`/store/costco/buy_it_again`) is the only previously-purchased surface, and it is **empty for guests**. Without Costco.com credentials the bias is impossible — be honest in the output (`previously_purchased_available: false`) rather than pretending. This is the core limitation of the task for an unauthenticated agent.
- **Sign-in is delegated to Costco.com.** The "Sign in via Costco.com" button leaves the Instacart storefront for Costco's own SSO. There is no in-storefront login form; an agent without real member credentials cannot pass it — treat as an auth wall, not a bug.
- **Storefront/Buy-It-Again URLs 302-redirect to `/?next=...` until context is set.** Hitting `/store/costco/storefront` or `/store/costco/buy_it_again` cold (fresh session, no guest/login choice made) bounces you to the landing page. Always make the guest/login choice first and keep the subsequent navigations in the **same `browserless_agent` call** (so they stay in one session — or, across separate calls, repeat the same `proxy`/`profile` config to reconnect to it), then navigate.
- **Delivery ZIP is IP-geolocated.** The storefront picks a delivery ZIP from the session's outbound IP (`97818` on a bare US session). Product availability and prices are ZIP-specific. If you need a specific delivery area, set it via the `Delivery <ZIP>` button in the header before searching; otherwise document the ZIP you actually got (it's in the header and in the output).
- **No proxy/stealth needed.** A plain `browserless_agent` call completed the entire flow; no Akamai block, captcha, or login wall on the storefront/search/add surfaces. Residential proxy / stealth are unnecessary (and a proxy only changes which ZIP you geolocate to).
- **Search is URL-driven — skip the typeahead.** `https://sameday.costco.com/store/costco/s?k=<q>` renders results directly; you don't need to interact with the search textbox. Wait ~3s after navigation before the `snapshot` (results render progressively).
- **Snapshots are large (500–700 refs).** Filter for `Add 1 ct`, `Current price`, and `Items in cart` rather than reading the whole tree — or use an `evaluate` to project just the product/price/cart nodes.
- **`Add` button vs. product button.** Each product card has TWO buttons: the product tile itself (opens the detail page) and the separate `Add 1 ct <name>` button. Click the **`Add`** button to add to cart without leaving the results page.
- **Internal APIs are session-gated.** The Instacart backend that powers search/cart is not usable cookieless (requires session bundle tokens). Don't waste time trying to hit a JSON endpoint directly — drive the rendered storefront.
- **Bulk-only sizing.** Costco results are warehouse multi-packs (e.g. "Kirkland Signature Eggs, Large, 5 dozen-count"). Match on product identity, not pack size, when the list item is generic ("eggs").
