# Find Carnival Cruise Line Australia Deals

## Purpose

Return the list of promotional cruise deals currently advertised on Carnival Cruise Line Australia's deals page (`carnival.com.au/cruise-deals`). Each deal is a marketing **bundle** (a named offer with a rate code, an "average from" per-person AUD price, a set of perks, and a book-by date), not an individual sailing. The skill optionally drills into any deal to surface the concrete sailings (ship, itinerary, nights, sail date, per-person price) that the deal applies to, via the `cruise-search` page. Read-only — it never books, holds, or proceeds to checkout.

## When to Use

- "What cruise deals is Carnival Australia running right now?"
- Monitoring promotional offers (reduced deposits, onboard credit, room upgrades) and their book-by deadlines.
- As a first step before a price-comparison flow: get the deal's rate code, then drill into `cruise-search` for actual sailing prices.
- Any flow that needs the current named offers + "from" prices without committing to a booking.

## Workflow

The deals page is a client-rendered Next.js app. Its server payload (`pageProps.data` inside `__NEXT_DATA__`) is **CryptoJS-AES encrypted** (`U2FsdGVkX1...` = `"Salted__"`), and the `/cruise-search` results page encrypts its payload the same way — so there is **no clean JSON/API path**. The recommended method is to render the page in a browser and read the deal cards from the DOM. A plain `browserless_agent` call (no proxy, no stealth) is sufficient — see Gotchas.

Do the whole flow inside **one `browserless_agent` call** — its `commands` array holds goto → wait → read (→ optional drill-down). The session persists across separate calls, keyed by the call's `proxy`/`profile` config, so batching saves round-trips and avoids accidentally dropping that config; repeat the same config on every call to stay in the same session.

1. **Open the deals page** (no proxy needed — see Gotchas). First command in the `commands` array:

   ```json
   {
     "method": "goto",
     "params": {
       "url": "https://www.carnival.com.au/cruise-deals",
       "waitUntil": "load",
       "timeout": 45000
     }
   }
   ```

   `carnival.com.au/cruise-deals` 301-redirects to `carnival.com.au/cruise-deals-2025?&dest=tp,nz,o,u,x`. A real browser follows the redirect natively — don't fight it.

2. **Wait for the React deal cards to render** (~3–5s after load fires):

   ```json
   { "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 5000 } }
   ```

3. **Read the cards** with a `{ "method": "text", "params": { "selector": "body" } }` command (or fold the parsing into an `evaluate` that returns a compact projection of the deal cards; use `{ "method": "snapshot" }` if you need refs / anchor hrefs). The page header reads "N Deals" (currently `4 Deals`, excluding the locked VIFP member tile). For each deal card extract:
   - **title** — e.g. "Fun-believable Deals", "Escape With Carnival", "Choice Plus", "Fun Select".
   - **price_from_aud** — the "Average price `$NNN`* pp" figure (per person, twin-share, AUD; the `*` denotes "starting price, taxes & fees included").
   - **perks** — the bulleted benefits (reduced/half-price deposits, onboard spending money, category upgrades, refundable deposits).
   - **book_by / sailing window** — the "Available on … through {month year} — Book by {date}" line (not present on every card).
   - **rate_code** & **shop_url** — from the card's "SHOP NOW" anchor href (see step 5). The rate code also appears in the `icid`.

4. **Handle the VIFP member tile.** One tile is a locked "Log in to unlock member-only deals" card (VIFP Club loyalty). It shows no price unless logged in. Emit it with `member_only: true` and a null price rather than dropping it.

5. **(Optional) Drill into concrete sailings.** Each deal's "SHOP NOW" button links to `cruise-search` with the deal's rate code, e.g.:
   ```
   https://www.carnival.com.au/cruise-search?cruisedeals=funbelievabledeals&rateCodes=k3p&dest=U,X,NZ,O,TP&sort=fromprice&showBest=true&pagenumber=1&pagesize=8
   ```
   Append the drill-down to the **same** `commands` array — a `goto` to that URL, then `{ "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 7000 } }`, then a `text`/`evaluate` read. The page shows a "SALES RATE APPLIED" badge, an "N Cruise Results" count (72 at capture time), and individual sailing cards: itinerary title (e.g. "2-Day Getaway from Melbourne, Australia"), ship (e.g. "Carnival Adventure"), and an "average per person" AUD price. **Do NOT click a sailing's book/select control** — stop at the results list.

No session-release step — there's nothing to release. The session persists across separate calls, keyed by the call's `proxy`/`profile` config; keeping the deals read and the optional cruise-search drill-down inside the one call's `commands` array saves round-trips and avoids accidentally dropping that config.

### Notes on inputs / assumptions

- Prices render in AUD and are per-person twin-share "from" figures. Assumed the user wants the advertised deal bundles (the page's own "Deals"); concrete sailing prices are provided via the optional drill-down.
- `dest=U,X,NZ,O,TP` is the default destination filter the deals page applies (Australia / South Pacific / New Zealand / Asia / Transpacific). The deals themselves are not destination-specific bundles.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **No usable API — payloads are AES-encrypted.** Both `/cruise-deals-2025` and `/cruise-search` are Next.js SSR apps whose `__NEXT_DATA__ → props.pageProps.data` is a CryptoJS-AES "Salted__" blob, decrypted client-side by `main.min.js` with an embedded key. Don't waste time fetching `/cruise-deals-2025/_next/data/{buildId}/index.json` or trying to parse `pageProps.data` directly — confirmed encrypted across iterations. Read the rendered DOM instead.
- **`/cruisesearch/api/targetedOffers/get` is NOT the deals feed.** It is the personalized "Targeted Offers" (TGO) endpoint and **requires a `PastGuestNumber` (VIFP loyalty number)** — a bare GET returns HTTP 400 `{"errors":{"PastGuestNumber":["The PastGuestNumber field is required."]}}`. It powers the logged-in member tile, not the public deal cards.
- **Stealth/proxies are NOT required.** The site is fronted by Akamai (sets `ak_bmsc`, `akacd_*`, `AKA_A2` cookies), but a **plain** `browserless_agent` call (no `proxy` arg, no stealth) loaded and rendered the deals page cleanly. The pre-run probe agreed (`likelyNeedsVerified:false`, `likelyNeedsProxies:false`), and a bare HTTP GET returns 200 on the homepage and deals page too. Don't add a residential `proxy` here unless behavior changes.
- **`/cruise-deals` redirects** → `/cruise-deals-2025?&dest=tp,nz,o,u,x` (301), and the assetPrefix/publicPath is `/cruise-deals-2025` (so static chunks live under that path). Navigate to `/cruise-deals` and follow it.
- **Deal cards render late.** A read (`text`/`snapshot`/`evaluate`) immediately after the goto `load` fires can miss cards — always insert a `waitForTimeout` of `5000` (deals) / `7000` (cruise-search) before reading.
- **The "N Deals" count excludes the locked VIFP tile.** The header said "4 Deals" while 5 tiles were visible (the 5th being the member-only login tile). Count the public ones; flag the member tile separately.
- **Rate codes live in the SHOP NOW href and the `icid`.** Observed mapping at capture: Fun-believable Deals=`k3p`, Escape With Carnival=`keh`, Choice Plus=`qcp`, Fun Select=`KNS`. These rotate with promotions and book-by dates — re-read them each run, don't hardcode.
- **Prices and book-by dates are time-sensitive promotions.** The "$316/$320/$400/$520" figures and "Book by 30 May 2026 / 2 June 2026" deadlines were current at capture (2026-05-30) and will change. Treat every field as live data to re-extract, not a constant.
- **Read-only.** Never click a sailing's select/book control or a "SHOP NOW → checkout" flow. Stop at the deal cards (or the cruise-search results list on drill-down).
