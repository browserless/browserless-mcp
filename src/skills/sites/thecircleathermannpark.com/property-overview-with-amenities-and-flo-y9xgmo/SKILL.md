      HTTP. A plain HTTP fetch (with or without a residential proxy) returns the
      'Just a moment…' interstitial HTML, not the rendered floor-plans grid — a
      real browser via `browserless_agent` is required to clear the challenge.

# Property Overview, Amenities & Floor Plans — The Circle at Hermann Park

## Purpose

Extract a complete read-only property overview for **The Circle at Hermann Park** (3 Hermann Museum Cir Dr, Houston, TX 77004): the building/community amenities, the in-apartment amenities, the surrounding neighborhood amenities, and every floor plan listed on the site — including each plan's code, bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, starting price, available-unit count, and availability status (Available Now / Inquire / Call / Waitlist). The site is a RentCafe-powered property page sitting behind Cloudflare's bot-challenge, so this skill is browser-driven with stealth turned on.

## When to Use

- A user asks for a high-level "tell me about this apartment building" digest of The Circle at Hermann Park.
- A user wants the current published rent / square footage / unit count for any specific floor plan at the property.
- A user wants to compare community amenities (pools, gym, garage, concierge, etc.) against in-unit amenities (granite, washer/dryer, walk-in closets, etc.).
- A user is researching the Hermann Park / Museum District neighborhood (Houston, TX 77004) as a relocation target and wants the bordering landmarks, schools, dining, and transit options the property advertises.

## Workflow

1. **Drive one `browserless_agent` call with stealth ON and a residential proxy.** The homepage and every RentCafe-rendered subpath sit behind Cloudflare's interactive challenge (`cf_chl_opt`, `Cf-Mitigated: challenge`). A plain HTTP fetch returns HTTP 403/500 with a "Just a moment…" interstitial. Set `proxy: { proxy: "residential" }` and put every page visit in one `commands` array — the session persists across calls (keyed by `proxy`/`profile`), and keeping the visits in one call keeps cookies live across `/`, `/amenities.aspx`, `/1/floorplans.aspx`, `/1/availableunits.aspx`, so the challenge is cleared once, not per nav.
2. **`goto` `https://www.thecircleathermannpark.com/`** (the canonical hostname — note the `www.` is mandatory; the apex returns connect-time TLS errors): `{ "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "https://www.thecircleathermannpark.com/", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } }` then a `{ "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 5000 } }` for Cloudflare to clear. The homepage carries the property name, the leasing phone `(855) 391-7677`, and the address `3 Hermann Museum Cir Dr, Houston, TX 77004`.
3. **`goto` `https://www.thecircleathermannpark.com/amenities.aspx`** and scrape the two sibling sections: **Community Amenities** and **Apartment Amenities**. A `{ "method": "text", "params": { "selector": "body" } }` is the cleanest grab — both lists are flat `<li>` rollups, no JS-gated expansion needed once the page is past the challenge. The `*` suffix in any amenity name means "select units only".
4. **`goto` `https://www.thecircleathermannpark.com/1/floorplans.aspx`** (the RentCafe-powered floor plans grid; note the `/1/` path prefix). Add a `waitForTimeout` of ~3000 ms and take a `{ "method": "snapshot" }`. Each plan card emits a deterministic node group in document order:
   ```
   div
     StaticText "<beds> Bed - <baths> Bath"  | "Studio"
     StaticText "|"
     StaticText "<sqft>"                       (may be empty, or prefixed with "Up to ")
     StaticText "sq.ft."
   heading: <plan_code>                        ← e.g. arA10, arA10.P6, arB5.P8, arS2.P6
   link:    <plan_code> floorplan overview
   image
   <price block>:
       StaticText "Starting at"
       StaticText "$1,425.00"
       superscript "/"
     StaticText "<N> Available Now"
     link    "View Details"
   OR (no current availability):
     StaticText "Inquire for details" | "Call for details" | "Waitlist"
     button   "Contact"
   ```
   **Bind the spec-block (Bed/Bath/sqft) to the heading that follows it, NOT the one that precedes it** — this is the single most common parsing bug for this page. See gotchas.
5. **(Optional) Confirm unit-level availability at `https://www.thecircleathermannpark.com/1/availableunits.aspx`** — this lists individual unit numbers with their own per-unit price, term, and move-in date. Useful when the floor plan card shows "N Available Now" but the user wants to see the actual unit grid.
6. **Read-only — do not click "View Details" / "Contact" / "Schedule a Tour" / "Apply Now".** Those routes are leasing-funnel CTAs and they spin up an applicant-account flow. Stop at the plan card.

### Browserless session config (mandatory)

| Setting                               | Required?   | Why                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| stealth (plain `browserless_agent`)   | yes         | Cloudflare otherwise serves a JS challenge on every navigation. If stealth alone still challenges, add a `{ "method": "solve", "params": { "type": "cloudflare" } }` after the `goto`.                                     |
| `proxy: { proxy: "residential" }`     | yes         | Without residential IPs the challenge escalates to a full block (HTTP 403 Akamai-style). Repeat the `proxy` arg on every call.                                                                                             |
| single `commands` array (one session) | recommended | The session persists across calls (keyed by `proxy`/`profile`) and is reused across `/`, `/amenities.aspx`, `/1/floorplans.aspx`, `/1/availableunits.aspx` within one call, avoiding re-solving the challenge on each nav. |

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **`www.` is mandatory.** Direct connections to `https://thecircleathermannpark.com/` (apex, no `www`) terminate at TLS with `Client network socket disconnected` (this is what the host pre-run antibot probe observed). Use `https://www.thecircleathermannpark.com/` everywhere.
- **Cloudflare bot challenge is universal across the site.** Every navigation including the RentCafe `/1/*.aspx` paths is gated by `cf_chl_opt`. Allow ~5 s wait after a goto before snapshot. a direct HTTP fetch with or without a residential proxy returns the "Just a moment…" interstitial HTML, not the real page.
- **Plan code naming convention.** `arA*` = one-bedroom, `arB*` = two-bedroom, `arC*` = three-bedroom, `arS*` = studio. The `.P6` and `.P8` suffixes are floor / building-wing variants (e.g. `arA10`, `arA10.P6`, `arA10.P8` are three views of the same base layout). A single base code can appear with all three variants and each variant has its own availability, so do **not** dedupe by base code.
- **Spec block (Bed/Bath/sqft) is rendered BEFORE its plan's heading in document order, not after.** Easy to misattribute to the previous card. The correct rule: the spec block immediately preceding `heading: <plan_code>` belongs to _that_ plan code. Confirmed against the rendered DOM in iter 1 — autobrowse's first-pass extraction got this wrong on the cards it summarized aloud.
- **Empty sqft fields are real, not parser failures.** Several variants (e.g. `arA10`, `arA13.P8`, `arB6.P8`, `arC4.P8`) intentionally publish no square footage; the page shows `| sq.ft.` with no number between the pipe and the unit. Encode as `null`, not `0`.
- **"Up to" prefix changes the semantic.** Two-bedroom code `arB5` and studio variant `arB5.P8` advertise `Up to 1,236` and `Up to 1,200` sq.ft. respectively — these are upper bounds, not exact figures. Preserve the `Up to` prefix when surfacing the value to the user.
- **Studios under a 2BR base code are real.** `arB5.P8` is listed as **Studio** at "Up to 1,200 sq.ft." even though every other `arB5*` variant is 2BR. Don't infer beds from the base letter — always read the rendered spec.
- **Pricing is shown ONLY for plans that have inventory.** Plans with `Inquire for details` or `Call for details` have no `Starting at $…` line at all; reporting them as `$0` or `null` is correct but make sure the `availability` field carries the human-readable status word.
- **Unit count appears as a free `StaticText` between the price block and the `View Details` link** (e.g. `10 Available Now`). It is _not_ inside the price div. Parsers that read only the price div will miss it.
- **No native API.** The site is plain ASP.NET (`.aspx`) + RentCafe; there is no public JSON endpoint exposing plans/availability. Don't waste a turn looking for one. The RentCafe internal `availableunits.aspx?floorPlans={id}&myOlePropertyId=527702` URL leaks the underlying property id (`527702`) and plan id (e.g. `2127833` for one of the studios) but those routes are equally Cloudflare-gated and still return HTML, not JSON.
- **Don't pre-emptively click "Apartment Amenities" or "Community Amenities" filter tabs on the amenities page.** Both lists are already in the DOM; clicking the filter only re-orders them. A single a text read of the body after page load returns both.
- **Phone, deposit, lease term are not surfaced on the floor plans page.** Leasing phone `(855) 391-7677` is in the page header banner across the site. Deposit and lease term only appear behind the "Apply Now" funnel — out of scope for read-only extraction.

## Expected Output

Return a single JSON object. Empty / unknown values are explicit `null`s, never omitted keys.

### Outcome shapes

- **`success: true` + populated `floor_plans` array** — happy path, what every successful run looks like.
- **`success: false` + `error_reasoning: "cloudflare-challenge-not-cleared"`** — session was launched without stealth and/or a residential proxy, page returned the "Just a moment…" interstitial. Re-run with both stealth flags.
- **`success: false` + `error_reasoning: "tls-handshake-failed"`** — caller used the apex `thecircleathermannpark.com` (no `www`). Retry against `https://www.thecircleathermannpark.com/`.
- **`success: true` with `currently_available_plans: 0`** — leasing inventory genuinely empty (every plan card shows "Inquire" / "Call" / "Waitlist"). The amenity arrays and plan metadata are still populated; only the pricing/units fields are uniformly `null`.
