# GitHub Pull Request Review Extraction

## Purpose

Given a GitHub pull request URL (or `owner/repo#number` slug), return a single normalized JSON document containing PR metadata, the full ordered review timeline, per-file diff annotations with inline review comments, and the latest check-run / status-context results. Read-only — never click Merge, Close, Approve, Request-changes, Comment, Resolve-conversation, or any other mutation control on the rendered page, and never POST to a mutating REST/GraphQL endpoint.

## When to Use

- Building a CR-summary or auto-review-digest for an inbox of open PRs.
- Snapshotting a PR's full review state for audit / compliance / retrospective use.
- Diffing two PRs (e.g., before/after a rebase) to see which review threads went stale.
- Anywhere you'd otherwise scrape `github.com/.../pull/N` HTML — the public REST API returns 99% of what the rendered page shows, faster and structurally.

## Workflow

GitHub's public **REST API** at `api.github.com` covers everything except thread-`isResolved` and `isCollapsed`, and resolves to 7 cheap, parallelizable HTTP calls per PR. **No browser, no anti-bot, no proxies required.** Use the rendered-HTML fallback only when (a) you need the `resolved` / `outdated` UI signals that REST does not expose, (b) the repo is private and the available auth token cannot reach it, or (c) GraphQL is unavailable and the REST rate-limit budget is exhausted.

**Transport (Browserless):** these are plain HTTPS JSON calls to `api.github.com` — the `curl`/HTTP examples below are canonical; run them from any client. Only under restricted egress, route via `browserless_function` (browser page context: `page.goto('https://api.github.com/')` then `page.evaluate` a same-origin `fetch` with the same headers). Never route auth tokens through the browser gratuitously; the token goes only to `api.github.com`.

### 1. Parse the input

Accept all four input shapes and reduce to `{owner, repo, number, anchor_review_id?}`:

| Input                                                        | Parse                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| `https://github.com/<o>/<r>/pull/<n>`                        | `o`, `r`, `n`             |
| `https://github.com/<o>/<r>/pull/<n>/files`                  | same; ignore `/files`     |
| `https://github.com/<o>/<r>/pull/<n>#pullrequestreview-<id>` | same + `anchor_review_id` |
| `<o>/<r>#<n>` slug                                           | `o`, `r`, `n`             |

### 2. Authenticate (optional but strongly recommended)

Unauthenticated rate-limit is **60 requests / hour** on the `core` resource and **0** on GraphQL — enough for ~6 PRs/hour at the 7-calls-per-PR rate below. Authenticated raises this to **5 000/hour** (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`). Any of the following tokens works:

- Classic PAT with `repo` scope (private) or no scope (public).
- Fine-grained PAT with `pull_requests:read` + `contents:read` on the target repo.
- GitHub App installation token (must be installed on the target repo).

For private repos, an auth wall without a usable token is an immediate `candidate` ship — REST returns `404 Not Found` (NOT 403) to disguise the existence of the repo. Detect this by asserting `repos/{o}/{r}` returns 200 with `private: true` after auth is attached.

### 3. Fetch the 7 endpoints in parallel

Endpoint base: `https://api.github.com`. Send `Accept: application/vnd.github+json`, `X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28`, and `User-Agent: <your-agent-name>` (UA is required and a missing UA returns 403). Paginate every list endpoint via the `Link: <...>; rel="next"` header; the implicit default is 30 per page, max 100 via `per_page=100`.

| #   | Endpoint                                                        | What it returns                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Call 1 first to learn `head.sha`, then fan out the rest. Calls 7a + 7b are both required for a complete picture: GitHub Actions writes to check-runs, third-party CIs may still write to the legacy combined-status surface, and many repos have both. Merge by `name`/`context` if you need to dedupe.

### 4. Assemble the timeline

The `/issues/{n}/timeline` endpoint already returns events in chronological order, but it does **not** carry the full payload for review submissions (only `event: "reviewed"` with `state` + `submitted_at` + `actor`) or for inline review comments (each `commented` entry is a top-level issue comment, not an inline review comment). Merge as follows:

1. Walk `timeline` and emit one event per item, keeping its natural `event` value as `type`.
2. For each `reviewed` event, look up the matching `pulls/{n}/reviews` entry by `id` (`timeline[i].id` matches `reviews[j].id`) to attach `body` and the list of inline `comments` whose `pull_request_review_id` equals that review's id. The inline-comment list comes from `pulls/{n}/comments`.
3. For each `commented` event, look up the matching `issues/{n}/comments` entry by `id` to attach the full `body` and edit metadata.
4. `cross-referenced` and `connected`/`disconnected` events carry **linked-issue / linked-PR** signals — there is no separate "linked issues" REST endpoint. A `connected` event with `source.issue.pull_request === undefined` is a linked issue; `pull_request !== undefined` is a linked PR. `disconnected` undoes a prior `connected`. Closing-keyword references in the PR body (`closes #N`, `fixes #N`) also surface as `connected` after the PR is merged; **do not** re-parse the PR body for closing keywords — let timeline events be the source of truth (post-merge they include keyword-derived links automatically).
5. Sort merged events by `created_at` ascending if you mix sources.

### 5. Assemble per-file annotations

For each `files[i]` from call 6:

- `file.path = files[i].filename`; if `files[i].status === "renamed"`, also record `file.previous_path = files[i].previous_filename`.
- Parse `files[i].patch` into hunks. Each hunk header has the form `@@ -<old_start>,<old_len> +<new_start>,<new_len> @@ <section_header>`. Each subsequent line is a context line (` `), addition (`+`), or deletion (`-`).
- Attach inline review comments by matching `comments[j].path === file.path` AND (active comments) `comments[j].position !== null`, OR (outdated comments) `comments[j].original_position` against the original commit's diff position.
- The **resolved** state of a thread is _not_ in REST. A REST-only assembly should mark every inline comment as `resolved: null` (unknown). To populate `resolved`, either (a) call GraphQL `pullRequest(number: N) { reviewThreads(first: 100) { nodes { isResolved isCollapsed comments(first: 100) { nodes { databaseId } } } } }` (requires auth), or (b) use the browser-fallback path in step 7 below.

### 6. Output

Emit the consolidated JSON per the schema in "Expected Output". Record which fields came from REST vs the rendered page in a top-level `_provenance` block (e.g., `{ "resolved_flags": "api-graphql" | "html-fallback" | "unavailable" }`) so downstream consumers know how confident to be.

### 7. Browser fallback (rendered HTML)

Use this **only** when (a) you need `resolved` / `outdated` UI flags and GraphQL isn't available, (b) you need to see the rendered "out-of-date branch" / merge-conflict banner that REST's `mergeable_state` summarizes coarsely, or (c) you need to render suggested-changes blocks that came in via inline-comment ```suggestion fences and want them post-applied to the diff.

The rendered HTML for `https://github.com/<o>/<r>/pull/<n>` (~600 KB) comes from a single `browserless_agent` `goto` + `{ "method": "html", "params": { "selector": "body" } }` (add `proxy: { proxy: "residential" }` if rate-limited). One `goto` is sufficient — no multi-step interactive driving. The relevant DOM markers:

- `data-resolved="true|false"` attribute on each `js-resolvable-timeline-thread-container` element. Sibling `data-deferred-content-url="/<o>/<r>/pull/<n>/threads/<thread_id>?..."` carries the GraphQL thread node id; sibling `data-hidden-comment-ids="<csv-of-comment-ids>"` lists the **inline review comment IDs** (matches `pulls/{n}/comments[i].id`) inside that thread. This is how you bridge REST comment-ids → thread.isResolved.
- `is-outdated` class on a comment container, OR `position: null` + non-null `original_position` on the REST inline comment, OR the rendered text `Outdated`/`Show outdated`. Treat any of these as `outdated: true`.
- `js-suggested-changes-blob` / class `suggested-change` on a code-suggestion block — the suggested replacement text appears in the comment body between ` ```suggestion ` and ` ``` ` fences (this is available via REST directly, no browser needed to parse).
- `branch-action-state-clean | dirty | unstable | unknown | blocked` on the merge-status container — the rendered equivalent of `pulls/{n}.mergeable_state`.
- `<div class="merged-banner">` / `<div class="branch-action-item branch-action-state-…">` for the merge / out-of-date banners.

### 8. GraphQL alternative (one call, requires auth)

When auth is available and REST's missing-fields are problematic, the entire payload is one `pullRequest` query against `https://api.github.com/graphql`. Key fields beyond REST:

- `reviewThreads(first:100) { nodes { isResolved isCollapsed path line startLine diffSide comments(first:100) { nodes { databaseId author { login } body createdAt updatedAt outdated } } } }`
- `closingIssuesReferences(first:50) { nodes { number title repository { nameWithOwner } } }` — definitive linked-issue list, post-merge or pre-merge.
- `mergeStateStatus` — finer-grained than REST's `mergeable_state`: `CLEAN | DIRTY | BLOCKED | BEHIND | DRAFT | HAS_HOOKS | UNKNOWN | UNSTABLE`.
- `latestReviews(first:100) { nodes { author { login } state submittedAt body } }` — already deduped to the _latest_ review submission per author, which REST does not provide.

GraphQL cost is **1 point per query** regardless of the number of nodes returned (within paginate limits), versus 7+ REST calls. Prefer GraphQL when auth is available; the REST flow above is the unauth fallback.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **Unauthenticated rate-limit is 60 requests/hour on the entire `core` resource, shared across all repos.** A typical PR costs 7 calls (more if reviews/comments/files paginate), so plan ~6 PRs/hour without auth. The `X-RateLimit-Remaining` header on every response tells you exactly how much you've used; check it before fanning out.
- **`User-Agent` header is mandatory** and a missing one returns `403 Forbidden`, not a more diagnostic error.
- **Private repos return 404, not 403, to anonymous callers.** Detect by attempting `repos/{o}/{r}` first with the available token; if that returns 200, the PR endpoint will too. If it returns 404 even with a token, the token lacks access — ship as `candidate` and document the auth wall.
- **`mergeable` is computed lazily.** The first call to `pulls/{n}` may return `mergeable: null` while GitHub schedules a test-merge. Retry once after 1–2 seconds; if still null, surface as `unknown`. The companion `mergeable_state` value (`clean`, `dirty`, `unstable`, `blocked`, `behind`, `draft`, `has_hooks`, `unknown`) is more granular than `mergeable` and is usually populated even when `mergeable` is null.
- **`state` is `open | closed` — NOT `merged` and NOT `draft`.** Determine merge state from the `merged` boolean field on the PR object, and draft state from `draft: true`. Many naïve clients treat `state` as a tri-state and miss merged-vs-just-closed.
- **PR-level conversation comments live under the `issues` resource, not `pulls`.** `GET /repos/{o}/{r}/pulls/{n}/comments` returns inline review comments only. Forgetting this is the most common single-endpoint mistake.
- **Review submissions with `state: COMMENTED` and empty `body` are normal.** They are containers for inline comments — emit them as part of the timeline but don't drop them as "empty noise."
- **Inline-comment `position: null` means the comment is _outdated_ — anchored to a line that no longer exists in the current head.** Use `original_position` + `original_commit_id` + `diff_hunk` to render an outdated comment at its historical line. There is no explicit `outdated: true` field in REST; the null `position` IS the signal.
- **Inline-comment `pull_request_review_id` ties each comment to its parent review submission.** When the parent is a `COMMENTED` review with no body, that's a single-comment drive-by review — completely normal, common in active codebases.
- **REST has no `resolved` / `isResolved` field on review comments or review threads.** This is the single most painful API gap. The two reliable sources: (a) GraphQL `pullRequest.reviewThreads.nodes.isResolved` (requires auth); (b) rendered HTML `data-resolved="true|false"` on the thread container (Browserbase Fetch path). Do not infer "resolved" from "no replies after N hours" or from `in_reply_to_id` patterns — neither is correlated.
- **`pulls/{n}/files` truncates patches over ~5 000 lines per file** (`patch` becomes `null` even when `additions + deletions > 0`). It also truncates the file list at **3 000 files** total — `files` array maxes there even with pagination. For very large PRs, fall back to `repos/{o}/{r}/compare/{base.sha}...{head.sha}` which returns the full diff in a single response (subject to the same truncation but expressed at the response level via `files` and `truncated: true`).
- **Timeline events for `committed` carry the commit message and SHA but NOT the file changes** — call `pulls/{n}/commits` separately if you need per-commit deltas. Most callers don't.
- **`head.repo` is `null` when the source fork has been deleted** (common on old merged PRs). The `head.ref` and `head.sha` are still populated; just don't expect `head.repo.full_name` to exist.
- **Force-pushes appear as `head_ref_force_pushed` events** carrying `before_sha` and `after_sha`. Inline comments anchored to the `before_sha` become outdated post-force-push (REST surface: `position: null`, `original_commit_id: <before_sha>`).
- **Check-runs vs status-contexts split.** GitHub Actions and the modern Checks API write to `commits/{sha}/check-runs`. Older third-party CIs (Travis, CircleCI ≤ v1, custom webhooks) still write to the legacy `commits/{sha}/status` endpoint. **Always query both** and merge by `name`/`context`; treating either as the sole truth misses CI signals routinely.
- **The `mockingbird` preview header on the timeline endpoint is no longer required** — `Accept: application/vnd.github.mockingbird-preview+json` works but `application/vnd.github+json` returns the same data. Default works.
- **GraphQL is rate-limited separately** (5 000 points/hour authenticated; 0 unauthenticated). A `pullRequest` query is 1 point regardless of node count. Strongly preferred over REST when you have auth.
- **Reviewer "approved" state is _per-submission_, not _per-user_.** The same reviewer can approve, then submit a follow-up `COMMENTED` review without re-approving. The PR-level "approved by N" rendered on the UI reflects the _latest_ submission state per user — GraphQL `latestReviews` gives you that; REST `pulls/{n}/reviews` returns every submission in order and you have to dedupe by `user.id` taking the last entry.
- **Suggested-changes blocks are plain markdown inside the comment body**: a fenced code block tagged ` ```suggestion `. No special API field — parse the comment body for the fence, and treat each `suggestion` block as a replacement for the lines anchored by the comment (`line`/`start_line` on the inline comment). The rendered "Apply suggested changes" button is UI-only and not a separate object.
- **`closes #N` / `fixes #N` keyword parsing of the PR body is unreliable as a "linked issues" source.** Use the timeline `connected` / `disconnected` events instead — they're authoritative and survive body edits. Post-merge, GitHub auto-creates `connected` events from the keywords, so you don't need to re-parse anyway.
- **The OpenGraph card endpoint `opengraph.githubassets.com/<cache-key>/<o>/<r>/pull/<n>`** returns a 1200×600 PNG summary of the PR (title, author, comments/reviews/files counts, +/− line counts, commit count) without any auth. Useful for marketplace thumbnails and quick previews; **not** a substitute for the structured JSON above. Rate-limited via the `<cache-key>` path component — vary it per request, and prefer a residential proxy (`proxy: { proxy: "residential" }`) on the load (we saw `429 Too Many Requests` on bare-IP fetches but `200 OK` through residential proxies).
- **No interactive browser session is needed for any of this.** The REST API + a single `browserless_agent` `goto` (for the rendered-HTML fallback) covers 100% of the surface. Multi-step interactive driving is strictly slower, costlier, and adds zero coverage.
