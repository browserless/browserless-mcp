# GitHub Trending Repositories Search

## Purpose

Return the current set of trending public repositories from [github.com/trending](https://github.com/trending), with optional filters for spoken language (e.g. Chinese), programming language (e.g. Python), and date range (`daily` / `weekly` / `monthly`). Each entry includes owner/repo name, description, programming language (+ language color), total stars, total forks, stars gained in the selected period, and the top contributing developers ("Built by"). Read-only — no auth, no cookies, no state mutation.

## When to Use

- Daily / weekly / monthly monitoring of what is currently trending on GitHub.
- Tracking trending repos within a specific programming language (e.g. "trending Rust this week").
- Tracking trending repos by **spoken language** (e.g. trending repos whose README is in Chinese, Japanese, Spanish — GitHub detects this from the README's natural-language content, not from anything the maintainer declares).
- Anywhere you'd want a server-rendered, parseable list of "what's hot on GitHub right now" — there is no official GitHub REST/GraphQL endpoint for this; the `/trending` HTML page is the canonical surface.

## Workflow

GitHub Trending is a **plain server-rendered HTML page** with no auth, no anti-bot, no JS rendering, and no XHR/GraphQL data layer behind it. The fastest, cheapest, most reliable path is to GET the URL with a vanilla User-Agent and parse the HTML — one HTTP request, ~1 second wall, no LLM cost. **Always lead with the fetch path.** A scripted browser session works as a fallback (the page snapshots cleanly via `browserless_agent`'s `snapshot` — verified at 558 a11y refs in a 16-repo run), but it pays a ~30× wall-clock penalty and burns turns for zero additional information vs. the raw HTML.

### 1. Build the URL

The three filters compose like this:

| Filter               | Where                                                     | Example                                                                                    |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Programming language | URL **path segment** (lowercase, kebab-case)              | `/trending/python`, `/trending/rust`, `/trending/objective-c`, `/trending/c%2B%2B` (`c++`) |
| Spoken language      | Query param `spoken_language_code` (ISO 639-1 two-letter) | `?spoken_language_code=zh` (Chinese), `=ja`, `=es`, `=ko`, `=ru`                           |
| Date range           | Query param `since` (default: `daily`)                    | `?since=daily`, `?since=weekly`, `?since=monthly`                                          |

Full example (all three filters): `https://github.com/trending/python?since=daily&spoken_language_code=zh`

The unfiltered base URL `https://github.com/trending` works too — it defaults to `since=daily` and "all languages."

### 2. Fetch the HTML

```bash
# any HTTP client — a vanilla User-Agent + Accept: text/html is fine
curl -sS -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0' \
  'https://github.com/trending/python?since=daily&spoken_language_code=zh'
```

Returns `200 OK` with `Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8` for anonymous unauthenticated requests. **No residential proxy required**, no anti-bot handling, no session, no cookies — verified 2026-05-21 from a sandbox IP, 0 failed requests across 214 page requests in browser trace. The `curl` example is canonical; run it from any client.

### 3. Parse the HTML

Each repo is wrapped in `<article class="Box-row">`. Iterate articles, then extract within each one:

| Field                           | Pattern                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `owner` / `repo`                | The `<h2 class="h3 lh-condensed">` block contains the heading anchor `<a href="/{owner}/{repo}">`. **Scope your href-match to inside the h2** — the article also contains earlier `<a href="/login?return_to=%2F{owner}%2F{repo}">` and `<a href="/{owner}/{repo}/stargazers">` links that will match a naïve "first href" pattern and produce wrong owner/repo (or "repo/stargazers") values.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `description`                   | `<p class="col-9 color-fg-muted my-1 tmp-pr-4">…</p>` — strip inner HTML, collapse whitespace. **Optional.** Some repos have no description. Class name has also been observed historically as `pr-4` (without the `tmp-` prefix) — match `(?:tmp-)?pr-4` for safety.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `language`                      | `<span itemprop="programmingLanguage">Python</span>`. **Optional** — repos with no detected language omit this entirely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `language_color`                | `<span class="repo-language-color" style="background-color: #3572A5">` — sits next to the language name.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `stars_total`                   | The text content of `<a href="/{owner}/{repo}/stargazers" …>` — formatted with commas (e.g. `"44,362"`). Strip tags, strip commas, parse as int.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `forks_total`                   | The text content of `<a href="/{owner}/{repo}/forks" …>` — same parse as stars.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `stars_period` + `period_label` | Free text inside `<span class="d-inline-block float-sm-right">…N stars today</span>` (or `…this week` / `…this month`). The regex `/([\d,]+)\s*stars?\s*(today\|this\s+week\|this\s+month)/i` works for all observed shapes. **CRITICAL: use `stars?` (singular OR plural).** Repos with exactly 1 star in the period render as `"1 star today"` (singular). **Also CRITICAL: this field is OPTIONAL** — repos with zero stars in the period sometimes omit the span entirely (observed in iter-1: 1 of 16 repos). Treat `null` as "no period-stars displayed" rather than zero. |
| `built_by`                      | Inside the "Built by" span at the end of the article: list of `<a href="/{username}"><img alt="@{username}"></a>` avatar links. Top 5 contributors of the period. The `@{username}` from `img.alt` is the cleanest extraction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `rank`                          | 1-indexed position in the article list (top of page = rank 1).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

### 4. Validate filter application

GitHub renders filter chips in the toolbar that confirm which filters were applied. The most reliable verification is to inspect the **page title** in the response: `<title>Trending {Lang} repositories on GitHub today · GitHub</title>` (daily), `… this week · GitHub` (weekly), `… this month · GitHub` (monthly). The title omits "spoken language" but reflects programming language + period.

### 5. Browser fallback

When direct HTTP is blocked (network egress restrictions, captive portals, corporate proxies that MITM github.com), drive a single `browserless_agent` call whose `commands` array navigates and snapshots:

```json
{
  "commands": [
    {
      "method": "goto",
      "params": {
        "url": "https://github.com/trending/python?since=daily&spoken_language_code=zh",
        "waitUntil": "load",
        "timeout": 45000
      }
    },
    { "method": "snapshot" }
  ]
}
```

No proxy and no anti-bot handling are needed (verified 2026-05-21 with a plain session — 0 anti-bot blocks across full trace). No session-release step (nothing to release). The session persists across separate calls, keyed by `proxy`/`profile`, so a later call with the same config reconnects to the same page; batching the whole nav → extract flow inside the one `commands` array simply saves round-trips. `snapshot` gives you all 16 article cards directly (a11y tree, ~558 refs — every article exposed as headings + links). For large pages prefer parsing in-page: an `{ "method": "html", "params": { "selector": "body" } }` returns the same HTML the fetch path returns (parse with the same selectors), or fold the parsing into an `{ "method": "evaluate", "params": { "content": "(()=>{ ... JSON.stringify(projection) })()" } }` and return a compact projection instead of raw HTML.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **No official API for Trending.** GitHub's REST and GraphQL APIs both have `search/repositories` endpoints that can sort by stars over a date range, but neither reproduces the editorial signal that powers `/trending` (which factors in star velocity, dedupes recently-popular repos, etc.). Don't waste time trying to back-derive `/trending` from `GET /search/repositories` — the result sets diverge significantly. The HTML page is canonical.
- **`Accept: application/json` is ignored.** `/trending` only renders HTML. No JSON variant, no RSS feed, no Atom feed.
- **Programming language is a URL path segment, not a query param.** `?language=python` is silently ignored — the page renders the all-language list. Use `/trending/python` instead. Slugs are lowercase; multi-word languages use the hyphenated form GitHub displays in the "Language" dropdown (e.g. `objective-c`, `common-lisp`, `vim-script`). For `C++` use `c%2B%2B` (URL-encoded `+` is required; `c++` works in browsers because they percent-encode automatically but raw HTTP clients won't).
- **Spoken language code is ISO 639-1, two-letter.** `zh` (Chinese), `ja` (Japanese), `es` (Spanish), `pt` (Portuguese), `ko` (Korean), `ru` (Russian), `de`, `fr`, etc. The dropdown surfaces all valid codes in the page's `<option value="spoken_language_code=XX">` elements — there is no separate API enum. Invalid codes are silently dropped and the page renders the all-languages list. Combining `spoken_language_code` with a programming-language path segment is allowed and works as AND.
- **`stars_period` text uses singular "star" when the count is 1.** `/(\d+)\s*stars\s+today/` will miss `"1 star today"` rows. Use `stars?` in your regex.
- **`stars_period` can be missing entirely** — not all rows have the `<span class="d-inline-block float-sm-right">N star(s) period</span>`. Observed 1 of 16 missing in a single fetch (~6%). Treat the field as nullable; do not default to `0` (the absence likely means the period delta is small/zero/not-yet-computed by GitHub, but the page is unambiguous about not displaying anything).
- **The "Built by" list is top-5 period contributors, not the repo's owners.** Maintainers, dependabot, github-actions, claude, and similar bot accounts routinely show up here. Don't conflate `built_by` with `owner`.
- **Heading anchor extraction must be scoped to the `<h2>`.** A naïve `<a href="/{owner}/{repo}">` regex over the whole article will match the _first_ href in the article — which is the "log in to star" affordance `<a href="/login?return_to=%2F{owner}%2F{repo}">` followed by `<a href="/{owner}/{repo}/stargazers">`. Both produce wrong values (the login href URL-encodes the slashes; the stargazers href produces `repo: "actualrepo/stargazers"`). **Match inside `<h2 class="h3 lh-condensed"> … </h2>`** to get the canonical repo link.
- **Description class name has two observed variants.** Currently `col-9 color-fg-muted my-1 tmp-pr-4` (post-Primer-CSS migration); historically and still seen in cached responses as `col-9 color-fg-muted my-1 pr-4`. Match `(?:tmp-)?pr-4`.
- **Max ~25 repos per page; no pagination.** GitHub intentionally caps Trending to a single page (typical: 15–25 entries depending on filter density). There is no `?page=2`. If you need more, change the date range to `weekly` or `monthly` — those produce different (broader) result sets.
- **No rate-limit observed for anonymous fetches at ≤ 1 req/s.** GitHub's standard anonymous rate limit (60 req/hr) applies to the API; HTML pages are throttled separately and `/trending` returns 200 reliably at human-paced polling. Authenticated requests count against the 5000 req/hr API budget but Trending is fine unauthenticated.
- **Third-party "trending API" mirrors are unreliable.** `ghapi.huchen.dev`, `trendings.herokuapp.com`, and similar Heroku/Cloudflare-Workers mirrors of the page exist but go offline regularly (their HTML scrapers break when GitHub re-themes the page — and several of the well-known ones haven't been updated since the 2024 Primer-CSS migration). Always go to source.

Failure shape (only realistic outcome — github.com/trending is operationally extremely reliable; the most likely failure is your egress being unable to reach github.com at all):

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "url": "https://github.com/trending/python?since=daily&spoken_language_code=zh",
  "filters": {
    "programming_language": "python",
    "spoken_language_code": "zh",
    "since": "daily"
  },
  "count": 0,
  "repos": [],
  "error_reasoning": "fetch failed: ECONNREFUSED github.com:443"
}
```

Field types:

- `count` — integer; equals `repos.length`. Typically 15–25.
- `repos[].description` / `repos[].language` / `repos[].language_color` / `repos[].stars_period` / `repos[].period_label` — all **nullable**. Treat missing-in-DOM as `null`, not `0` / `""`.
- `repos[].stars_total` / `repos[].forks_total` — integers, parsed from comma-formatted display strings.
- `repos[].built_by` — array of GitHub usernames (strings), may be empty.
- `period_label` — one of `"stars today"`, `"stars this week"`, `"stars this month"`, or `null`. The label tracks the `since` filter; expect consistency within a single result page.
