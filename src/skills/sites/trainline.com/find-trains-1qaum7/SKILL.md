# Trainline — Find Train Times & Prices

## Purpose

Given a one-way or return journey query — origin station, destination station, outbound date/time (and optional return), passenger count — return a structured list of train options from trainline.com (canonical host: `thetrainline.com`). Each option carries departure & arrival times, origin & destination station names, duration, number of changes, operator (carrier), cheapest and standard/first-class prices, and fare type. **Read-only — never click "Buy"; stop at the results list.**

Recommended path is **hybrid**: hit Trainline's clean public locations-search JSON API (no auth, no anti-bot) to resolve station URN codes, then open a single deep-link `/book/results?...` URL in a `browserless_agent` call carrying a residential proxy and extract the rendered journey cards. The page's underlying `/api/journey-search/` XHR endpoint is gated by DataDome cookies and is **not** directly callable; the deep-link route is the cheapest reliable surface (one navigation, no form-filling).

## When to Use

- "what are the cheapest morning trains from London to Edinburgh on 15 Jun?"
- Daily / hourly monitoring of fares on a fixed route (e.g. commute fare-tracking).
- Comparison flows across UK + European rail/bus carriers — Trainline aggregates ATOC (UK rail), Eurostar, SNCF, DB, Trenitalia, Renfe, NationalExpress (UK coach), Benerail, Distribusion, and more.
- Building itinerary suggestions when departure/arrival times matter (not just price).
- Anywhere you'd otherwise scrape the trainline.com homepage by filling form fields — the deep-link bypasses that flow entirely.

## Workflow

### 1. Resolve station URN codes via the locations-search API

This endpoint is a plain HTTPS GET returning JSON — no auth, no DataDome. It is same-origin to `www.thetrainline.com`, so run it through a `browserless_function` that navigates to the origin first, then does an in-page fetch (the function body runs in a browser page context — a bare `fetch` has no egress until the page has navigated):

```js
export default async function ({ page }) {
  await page.goto('https://www.thetrainline.com/', {
    waitUntil: 'load',
    timeout: 45000,
  });
  const term = 'London'; // URL-encode the caller's search term
  const data = await page.evaluate(async (t) => {
    const r = await fetch(
      `/api/locations-search/v2/search?searchTerm=${encodeURIComponent(t)}&locale=en-US`,
    );
    return r.json();
  }, term);
  // project only the fields you need to stay under the result-size cap
  return {
    data: (data.searchLocations || []).map((l) => ({
      name: l.name,
      code: l.code,
      type: l.locationType,
      country: l.countryCode,
    })),
    type: 'application/json',
  };
}
```

Response shape (full `searchLocations` entry):

```json
{
  "searchLocations": [
    {
      "name": "London",
      "code": "urn:trainline:generic:loc:182gb",
      "locationType": "stationGroup",
      "countryCode": "GB",
      "score": 1.0,
      "extraInfo": { "subtitle": "Any", "attributes": ["BusStation","category:point"] }
    },
    {
      "name": "London Euston",
      "code": "urn:trainline:generic:loc:EUS1444gb",
      "locationType": "station",
      "shortName": "EUS",
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

- **`locale=en-US` is required** — omitting it returns `400 {"errors":[{"code":"ReferenceDataSearch.Request.Validation.Locale","detail":"The Locale field is required."}]}`. The locale value itself doesn't materially affect station results.
- `score` is sorted descending. The first hit is usually correct.
- `locationType: "stationGroup"` is a city-level "Any station" pseudo-location (e.g. "London (Any)" = `182gb`) — use this for city-name queries to maximise coverage. `locationType: "station"` is a specific terminal (e.g. `EUS1444gb` = London Euston) — use this when the user named the exact terminal.
- The endpoint has **no auth and no DataDome gate** — the in-page fetch above works reliably. (A residential proxy is not required for this endpoint; you can also fetch it from any plain HTTPS client outside Browserless. The `browserless_function` route just keeps the run consistent with the browser step downstream.)
- Cache the URN per `(name, countryCode)` pair — they're stable across runs.

**Known-good URNs (verified 2026-05-22)**:

| Station                         | URN                                   |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| London (Any)                    | `urn:trainline:generic:loc:182gb`     |
| London Euston                   | `urn:trainline:generic:loc:EUS1444gb` |
| London Kings Cross              | `urn:trainline:generic:loc:KGX6121gb` |
| London Paddington               | `urn:trainline:generic:loc:PAD3087gb` |
| London St Pancras International | `urn:trainline:generic:loc:STP1555gb` |
| London Waterloo                 | `urn:trainline:generic:loc:WAT5598gb` |
| Edinburgh (Waverley)            | `urn:trainline:generic:loc:EDB9328gb` |

### 2. Set up the deep-link run

The results deep-link is DataDome-gated, so drive it with a single `browserless_agent` call carrying a **residential proxy** — this is **mandatory**. A proxy-less agent triggers DataDome blocking on `/book/results`. Pass the proxy as a top-level arg on the call:

```json
{ "proxy": { "proxy": "residential" }, "commands": [ ... ] }
```

A `browserless_agent` session **persists across separate calls** — it is keyed by the call's `proxy`/`profile` config, so a later call carrying the same `proxy` reconnects to the same warmed browser (current page, cookies, and DataDome clearance all intact). Batching the whole flow (navigate → wait → extract) into that one call's `commands` array is still the convenient default — it saves round-trips and avoids accidentally dropping the session config — and there is **no session-release step** to run afterward. Repeat the `proxy` arg on every call; dropping or changing it lands you in a different, proxy-less (and DataDome-walled) session.

### 3. Navigate to the deep-link results URL

Construct:

```
https://www.thetrainline.com/book/results
  ?origin=<URLENC origin URN>
  &destination=<URLENC destination URN>
  &outwardDate=<URLENC 2026-06-15T09:00:00>           # ISO local time, no zone suffix
  &outwardDateType=departAfter                          # or 'arriveBefore'
  &journeySearchType=single                             # 'single' | 'open-return' | 'return'
  &passengers[]=1996-01-01                              # passenger DOB, one entry per traveller
  # for return trips:
  # &returnDate=2026-06-17T17:00:00
  # &returnDateType=departAfter
```

URL-encode the URNs (`:` → `%3A`) and the `[` `]` in `passengers[]` (`%5B%5D`).

Then, in the same `browserless_agent` `commands` array:

```json
{ "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "<URL>", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } },
{ "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 5000 } }
```

(The `waitForTimeout` covers the journey cards streaming in after the initial load. Never use a networkidle wait — it hangs on this SPA.)

The URL bar will gain an extra `&selectedOutward=...` param after first results render — Trainline auto-selects the first journey. Ignore it.

### 4. Extract journey cards

Two extraction routes — use whichever fits your downstream needs:

**Route A — `{ "method": "text", "params": { "selector": "body" } }` (preferred for cheap text-based extraction)**

Each journey card surfaces as a roughly contiguous run of text matching:

```
{origin station name} to {destination station name}{h-and-min duration}{long duration}, {N changes}{operator}{fare type}{price}...T&C boilerplate
```

Example real text from one card:

```
London Kings Cross to Edinburgh (Waverley)4h 17m4 hours 17 minutes, 0 changesLumoFixed (Standard Class)$67.61Specified train only. No refunds. Only valid on booke...
```

Split on `to {destination station name}` (or use a regex anchored on `\d+h \d+m`) and parse each chunk.

**Route B — `{ "method": "snapshot" }` (preferred for structured extraction with times)**

The accessibility tree gives one `listitem` per journey card with this canonical sub-structure:

```
[X-Y] listitem                                  ← one journey card
  ...
  StaticText: departs at 9:03 am                ← departure time (12h format on en-US locale)
  StaticText: arrives at 1:32 pm                ← arrival time (suffix " +1" if next-day)
  StaticText: Plat. 1
  StaticText: estimated                         ← realtime/estimated indicator
  StaticText: London Kings Cross                ← origin station
  StaticText: Edinburgh (Waverley)              ← destination station
  group                                         ← fare options
    radio: Standard fare, cost: $88.92          ← cheapest standard-class price
    StaticText: Only 6 left                     ← (optional) seat-scarcity warning
    radio: First class fare, cost: $185.89      ← (optional) first-class price
    StaticText: Only 7 left
  button: Duration, 4 hours 29 minutes. 0 changes. Button. Click to open live tracker
    StaticText: 4 hours 29 minutes              ← duration (long form)
    StaticText: 0 changes                       ← '0 changes' = direct; otherwise 'N change(s)'
```

The button label string `"Duration, 4 hours 29 minutes. 0 changes."` is the most reliable single source — extract duration and changes from there in one regex.

**Operator name (LNER, Lumo, Avanti West Coast, TransPennine, CrossCountry, Eurostar, SNCF, Deutsche Bahn, NationalExpress, ...)** does not appear as `StaticText` in the snapshot — it's rendered as a carrier-logo image (`image: carrier logo`). It DOES appear inline in the `text` (body) output between the changes count and the fare-type label. Use Route A's text path to capture the operator string.

### 5. Stop. Do not click "Buy" or proceed to fare selection.

This skill is read-only. Closing the loop with a purchase is out of scope (and belongs in a separate `trainline.com/book-ticket` skill if ever needed).

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **Canonical host is `thetrainline.com`, not `trainline.com`**: `trainline.com` 301-redirects to `thetrainline.com`. Always issue requests to `www.thetrainline.com`.
- **DataDome anti-bot wall, with a twist**: Trainline uses DataDome (`geo.captcha-delivery.com`). The captcha iframe (`[X-Y] Iframe: Verification system` containing a `RootWebArea: You have been blocked`) **appears in the snapshot tree on a residential-proxy session but does NOT block the underlying results from rendering**. Do not waste turns trying to solve or dismiss the iframe — read past it. Without a residential proxy the entire page is replaced by the DataDome interstitial; with the proxy set, the iframe is cosmetic and the results panel renders normally. If a run does land on the full interstitial, a `solve { type: "dataDome" }` command in the same agent call can clear it.
- **`/api/journey-search/` is DataDome-gated and effectively closed to programmatic clients.** Confirmed not callable from an out-of-band fetch (no DataDome cookies → 403/redirect to captcha). The deep-link URL is the only practical surface; do NOT spend iterations attempting a direct POST to `/api/journey-search/`.
- **`/api/locations-search/v2/search` IS open** — no auth, no DataDome, returns JSON. Just remember `locale=en-US` is required. This makes the locations step ~10× cheaper than driving the homepage type-ahead via the browser.
- **Currency follows session locale, not URL params.** A US-IP residential-proxy session lands on `/en-us` and shows prices in **USD**. `&currency=GBP` query param is **ignored**. `/en-gb/book/results` **404s** ("Oops! We can't find the page you're looking for") — the locale prefix isn't a real route. To get **GBP** prices, you need a UK-region proxy (set `proxyCountry: "gb"` alongside `proxy: { proxy: "residential" }`) or change the user's currency by clicking the currency-switcher in the header (`button: Change language or currency` → "Pound Sterling") and then re-navigating to the results URL — the choice persists via the `tlCurrency` / `CULTURE_INFO` cookies. **Always emit the observed currency in the output JSON** rather than assuming GBP/USD.
- **Wrong URN ⇒ ghost search**: Random integer URNs (e.g. `urn:trainline:generic:loc:1006`) resolve to real-but-irrelevant European stations ("Ebersheim", "St-Jean-de-Monts Esplanade de la Mer") and render "No tickets available, please refine your search". The locations API in Step 1 is the only safe URN source — do NOT guess.
- **`passengers[]=YYYY-MM-DD` is passenger DOB, not passenger count.** Each entry is one person's date of birth, which Trainline uses to bucket fare class (`1996-01-01` → 26-59 adult, `2015-01-01` → child, `1955-01-01` → senior). For "1 adult" use `passengers[]=1996-01-01`. For "2 adults" repeat it (`passengers[]=1996-01-01&passengers[]=1996-01-01`). For railcards (16-25, Two Together, Senior), add `&railcards[]=<code>` — codes are observable in the locations API responses' `connections` array (e.g. `urn:trainline:connection:atoc`).
- **`outwardDate` is local (station) time, not UTC.** Format: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS`, no `Z`, no timezone offset. Trainline interprets it in the origin station's timezone.
- **`outwardDateType=departAfter` returns the next ~4-6 trains departing AT-OR-AFTER the given time.** Use `arriveBefore` if the user wants "trains arriving before X". The page shows tabs for ±3 days around the chosen date for cross-day flexibility.
- **Times on en-US locale are 12-hour ("9:03 am").** Convert to 24-hour in the output JSON for consistency. Times occasionally suffix " +1" when the train arrives the next day (overnight services like the Caledonian Sleeper).
- **Operator name is in body text only, not the snapshot.** Carrier logos appear as `image: carrier logo` in the snapshot tree without an alt label. The operator string ("LNER", "Lumo", "Avanti West Coast", etc.) IS present in the `text` (body) output, sandwiched between the "N changes" string and the fare-type label. If you need operators, use the text-body route (Route A in Step 4).
- **Cookie consent banner is non-blocking.** A "Choose Cookies / Accept Cookies" overlay appears on first session navigation. It doesn't gate the results — click "Accept Cookies" only if you want clean screenshots; otherwise skip.
- **Multiple result-pages aren't paginated, they're "Earlier / Later" buttons.** The default render shows 4-6 journeys around your requested time. To get more, click `button: Find earlier trains` (ref label "Earlier") or the analogous "Later" button. Don't expect a `&page=2` URL — there isn't one.
- **`selectedOutward=<base64>` URL suffix appears after first render.** Trainline auto-pins the first journey as selected. Ignore it for extraction; do NOT pass it back when navigating fresh.
- **Tabs for adjacent dates work:** The `tablist` near the top contains `tab: Mon, Jun 15`, `tab: Tue, Jun 16`, etc. Clicking a tab updates the results in-place — cheaper than re-navigating the deep-link URL for cross-day comparison flows.

**Other outcome shapes**:

- **No journeys for date/route** → `success: true, options: [], note: "no_journeys_found"` plus the page's "No tickets available, please refine your search" copy in `error_reasoning`.
- **Origin / destination unresolved** → `success: false, error_reasoning: "could_not_resolve_<origin|destination>", search_term: "<input>"`. Don't proceed to deep-link with a guessed URN.
- **DataDome hard-block (rare; only on bare sessions)** → `success: false, error_reasoning: "datadome_blocked", note: "Re-run with a residential proxy (proxy: { proxy: \"residential\" })."` Capture the iframe URL (`geo.captcha-delivery.com/captcha/...`) and HTTP status if visible.
- **Wrong currency observed** → still return the results; emit the observed currency (`"USD"` from a US-region proxy, `"GBP"` from a UK proxy, `"EUR"` for some EU sessions) so downstream consumers can convert.
