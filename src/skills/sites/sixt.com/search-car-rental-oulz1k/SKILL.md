# Sixt Car Rental Search

## Purpose

Given a pickup location, dropoff location, pickup/dropoff date+time, and (optionally) a preferred vehicle class, return the full list of car-rental offers Sixt surfaces at the requested branch — each with vehicle class, sample model, seats/doors/transmission, mileage policy, total price, and per-day price. Read-only — **never** click the per-card "Book" button or the global continue/checkout button.

## When to Use

- A user asks "what cars can I rent at LAX next weekend?" or similar (city/airport + date range + optional class).
- Comparing prices/availability across multiple Sixt branches on the same dates.
- Bulk fleet/price extraction for one branch on different dates.
- Anywhere a Sixt-specific offer-list snapshot is needed; if the user wants cross-vendor comparison they should use Kayak/Expedia/Google instead.

## Workflow

The Sixt offer-list is a JS-rendered SPA at `/betafunnel/#/offerlist?<zen_…>` whose state lives entirely in the URL hash. The recommended path is **browser + deep-link** — drive the homepage typeahead once to resolve the branch's location-UUID and `BRANCH:<id>` code, then either submit the form or jump straight to a constructed `/betafunnel/#/offerlist?…` URL. There is **no public REST/JSON endpoint** — the backend is binary gRPC at `grpc-prod.orange.sixt.com` (`com.sixt.service.rent_booking.api.SearchService/*`), which is not practical to call from a scripted client. Cloudflare protects the site, so drive it with a stealth + residential-proxy session.

### 1. Session model

A `browserless_agent` session **persists across separate calls**, keyed by the call's `proxy` config — there is no session to create up front and no release step. Because Sixt sets `__cf_bm` Cloudflare cookies on every request and a cold context sometimes 403s on the betafunnel SPA, keep the whole cold-discovery flow (homepage → typeahead → dates → submit → extract) inside **one** `browserless_agent` `commands` array so the Cloudflare cookies and SPA state carry across steps without any chance of dropping the config mid-flow. Pass the same proxy on **every** call — a call that drops or changes it lands in a different, blank session:

```json
{
  "proxy": { "proxy": "residential", "proxyCountry": "us" },
  "commands": [/* steps 2–6 below, in order */]
}
```

Residential proxy + advanced stealth (the default) is recommended. A US-egress proxy (`proxyCountry: "us"`) is what forces the `EN | $` locale — see step 2.

### 2. Open homepage and dismiss the privacy dialog

```json
{ "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "https://www.sixt.com/", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } },
{ "method": "snapshot" },
{ "method": "click", "params": { "selector": "<ok-ref from snapshot>" } }
```

Take a `snapshot` to locate the cookie/privacy OK button, then `click` it to dismiss the GDPR/cookie banner. The privacy dialog appears as the topmost button group on the first paint. Locale `EN | $` shows for US IPs; if the snapshot shows EUR / a different language, the proxy egress is non-US — there is no `&pos=us`-style param, so re-run the call with `proxyCountry: "us"` if currency matters.

### 3. Fill the pickup location via typeahead

```json
{ "method": "type",     "params": { "selector": "[data-testid=\"ibe-pickup-location-input\"]", "text": "Los Angeles International Airport" } },
{ "method": "snapshot" },
{ "method": "click",    "params": { "selector": "<typeahead-option-ref — e.g. \"Los Angeles Int Airport\">" } }
```

Use the `type` command with a full quoted phrase — a multi-word location goes in one string, and `type` is purpose-built for input boxes. `type` does NOT auto-press Enter on this field, so you must `snapshot` the populated dropdown and `click` the first matching menuitem explicitly; otherwise the form submits with an unbound location.

When pickup == dropoff, leave "Different return location" unchecked — Sixt copies the pickup branch into both `zen_pu_branch_id` and `zen_do_branch_id`. For a different dropoff, `click` that checkbox first, then `type` into a second input that surfaces.

### 4. Set dates and times

```json
{ "method": "click", "params": { "selector": "<pickup-date-button-ref>" } },   // opens 3-month calendar
{ "method": "click", "params": { "selector": "<jun-10-day-button-ref>" } },     // pickup date
{ "method": "click", "params": { "selector": "<jun-14-day-button-ref>" } },     // return date (same calendar)
{ "method": "click", "params": { "selector": "<pickup-time-button-ref>" } },    // opens 15-minute-grid time list
{ "method": "click", "params": { "selector": "<10-00-am-option-ref>" } },
{ "method": "click", "params": { "selector": "<return-time-button-ref>" } },
{ "method": "click", "params": { "selector": "<10-00-am-option-ref>" } }
```

Re-`snapshot` between these if the refs shift. The calendar opens once and accepts both pickup + return clicks before closing. Time pickers open separately for pickup and return. Default time is 12:00 PM if you don't override.

### 5. Submit and grab the constructed deep-link

```json
{ "method": "click", "params": { "selector": "<show-cars-button-ref>" } },
{ "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 4000 } },
{ "method": "evaluate", "params": { "content": "(()=>JSON.stringify({deeplink: location.href}))()" } }
```

The `click` on "Show cars" navigates to the offer-list SPA (waiting on `load`); the `waitForTimeout` gives the offer cards the 2-4s they need to render after `load`; the `evaluate` returns the constructed deep-link (under `.value`) so you can cache/replay it. That `deeplink` will look like:

```
https://www.sixt.com/betafunnel/#/offerlist
  ?zen_pu_location=a70b64b2-6cb4-4828-ba9d-a091ada36870
  &zen_do_location=a70b64b2-6cb4-4828-ba9d-a091ada36870
  &zen_pu_title=Los%20Angeles%20Int%20Airport
  &zen_do_title=Los%20Angeles%20Int%20Airport
  &zen_pu_time=2026-06-10T10%3A00
  &zen_do_time=2026-06-14T10%3A00
  &zen_pu_branch_id=BRANCH%3A40352
  &zen_do_branch_id=BRANCH%3A40352
  &zen_offer_matrix_id=37e8a8ba-4682-48d5-a328-6dea803ece55   <-- ephemeral, can be dropped
  &zen_vehicle_type=car
  &zen_pickup_country_code=US
  &zen_resident_country_required=false
  &zen_point_of_sale=US
  &zen_filters=%7B%22group_type%22%3A%5B%5D%2C...%7D         <-- empty JSON object also works
  &zen_order_is_ascending=false
  &zen_order_by=
```

Once the `(zen_pu_location, zen_pu_branch_id)` pair for a branch is known, you can skip steps 2-4 on subsequent runs and `goto` the constructed URL directly (a single `browserless_agent` `goto` command on the deep-link) — the page re-renders the full offer list on cold load. **`zen_offer_matrix_id` is NOT required** (confirmed: removing it still produces a full offer list). The location UUID + `BRANCH:<id>` pair is the only branch-identity primary key.

Cache `{display_name → (location_uuid, branch_id)}` keyed by airport code / city — discovery costs one full homepage flow (~25-30 turns); replay costs one URL open (1 turn).

### 6. Extract offers from the rendered page

Add a `text` command to the same `commands` array to pull the body as markdown:

```json
{ "method": "text", "params": { "selector": "body" } }
```

The markdown serialization is dense and reliable. (Alternatively, fold the parsing into an `evaluate` that walks the offer cards and returns a `JSON.stringify`'d array — cleaner than shipping raw markdown, but the markdown pattern below is well-understood.) Each offer card is a `####` h4 block:

```
#### Compact Sedan
NISSAN VERSA
Or similar model
5            <- seats
3            <- doors (note: doors include the trunk hatch; "4" usually means 4-door)
Automatic    <- transmission
![Compact Sedan](https://www.sixt.com/.../nissan-versa-4d-grey-2023.png)
Unlimited miles
41$51$41.51/day    <- per-day price (the doubled "41$51" + "$41.51" comes from the markdownifier reading both <span> and aria-label; the canonical "/day" half is "$41.51")
251$14$251.14total <- total price for the whole rental
```

Regex to parse each block (line-by-line):

- **vehicle_class** = the `####` header text, e.g. `Compact Sedan`, `Intermediate SUV`, `Fullsize Convertible`. Sixt's class names follow `<Size> [Elite] <Body>` where Size ∈ `{Mini, Economy, Compact, Intermediate, Standard, Fullsize, Premium, Luxury}`, Body ∈ `{Sedan, SUV, Hatchback, Convertible, Pick-up, Van, Wagon}`, and the optional `Elite` qualifier indicates premium brand (BMW/Mini/Mercedes-style).
- **sample_model** = next non-empty line below the heading (e.g. `NISSAN VERSA`).
- **brand_tag** = next line: `Or similar model` (generic) or `Premium Brand` (Elite tier).
- **seats / doors / transmission** = the next three single-token lines.
- **badges** = optional lines `Top pick`, `Highly rated`, `Hot offer` (in their own short lines).
- **mileage_policy** = the line immediately above the price, e.g. `Unlimited miles` or `700 miles included`.
- **price_per_day** = parse the `/day` line; the canonical value is the dotted form after the second `$`: `41$51$41.51/day` → `$41.51`.
- **total_price** = the `total` line; same pattern: `251$14$251.14total` → `$251.14`.
- **image_url** = the `![alt](url)` PNG href, useful for visual confirmation of vehicle class.

Currency symbol on the price strings reflects the page's locale (`$` for US point-of-sale, `€` for DE, `£` for UK). Read it once from the header `EN | $` button label.

### 7. Filter to the requested vehicle class

**Filter client-side, not via URL.** The `zen_filters` URL param exists but its filter-key enum (`group_type`, `passengers_count`, `bags_count`, `minimum_driver_age`, `features`, `special_rentals`) does NOT accept human-readable category names — passing `{"group_type":["compact"]}` in a fresh navigation returns the full unfiltered list. The reliable approach is to read every offer card and filter the parsed array by a substring match against `vehicle_class`:

```js
const requested = 'Compact'; // user's preferred class
const matches = offers.filter((o) =>
  o.vehicle_class.toLowerCase().includes(requested.toLowerCase()),
);
// matches will include "Compact Sedan", "Compact SUV", "Compact Elite SUV", etc.
```

If the request is more specific (e.g. "Compact SUV"), tighten the substring. If it returns no matches, surface the full list as `closest_alternatives` so the caller can pick.

### 8. Session continuity

No explicit release step — there is nothing to release. Steps 2-6 are batched into a single call's `commands` array so the Cloudflare `__cf_bm` cookies and SPA hash-state stay together and you never risk dropping the proxy mid-flow. A follow-up call that repeats the **same** proxy reconnects to the same warmed session (cookies and SPA state intact); a follow-up call that drops or changes the proxy lands in a different, blank context.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **READ-ONLY.** Never click the per-card "Book Now" or the offer-detail "Continue" button — that progresses into the booking funnel (extras → driver details → payment).
- **Pass the multi-word location as one string.** The `type` command takes the full location phrase in a single `text` value (e.g. `"text": "Los Angeles International Airport"`) — do not split it into tokens. `type` does not auto-press Enter on the Sixt typeahead, so you must `snapshot` the dropdown and `click` the suggestion explicitly.
- **Privacy/cookie dialog blocks the form.** A modal overlay covers the search inputs on first visit; clicks on the form silently no-op until it is dismissed. The dialog's OK ref shifts between snapshots — re-snapshot before clicking.
- **`zen_filters` server-side filtering is broken / undocumented.** Passing `{"group_type":["compact"]}` (or any human-readable category name) returns the full unfiltered list; the page applies filters in-client after fetch. Always parse-and-filter client-side. If you need server-side filtering, you would have to drive the on-page Filters UI (a sidebar/modal with checkboxes), but that costs ~5-10 extra turns vs ~0 for client-side filter.
- **`zen_offer_matrix_id` is ephemeral but optional.** A new value is minted per search; removing it from the URL still yields a full offer list on cold navigation. Don't cache it.
- **`zen_pu_location` is a UUID, not a guessable code.** The location-UUID for each branch (e.g. `a70b64b2-6cb4-4828-ba9d-a091ada36870` for LAX) is opaque and must be discovered via the homepage typeahead the first time you target a branch. Cache `{airport_code → (location_uuid, branch_id)}` after first discovery to avoid the ~25-turn cold-discover cost on repeat runs.
- **`BRANCH:<n>` is the Sixt internal station id.** It's surfaced both in `zen_pu_branch_id` and (un-prefixed) in the page's analytics events as `pickup_station_id=40352`. The `40352` numeric form alone is also exposed in `window.dataLayer` GA events if you need a stable canonical id.
- **No JSON/REST API.** Sixt's backend uses binary gRPC-Web at `grpc-prod.orange.sixt.com/com.sixt.service.rent_booking.api.SearchService/{GetSelectedLocation,GetBranchRecommendations,...}`. The wire format is protobuf — not practical to call directly without the .proto definitions, and the endpoint requires browser-context auth/csrf cookies. **Don't waste time looking for a public JSON endpoint — it doesn't exist.** `/php/reservation/*` paths 302 back to `/`.
- **Price markdown is doubled.** Reading the body as markdown (`text` on `body`) renders prices as `41$51$41.51/day` because the page interleaves a visual integer/decimal split (`<span>41</span><span>$</span><span>51</span>`) with a hidden full-dollar-string. Take the value after the second `$` (`$41.51/day`) as canonical.
- **"doors" includes the rear hatch on SUVs/wagons.** A 4-door sedan is "4"; a 4-door SUV with a tailgate is also "4" or "5" depending on Sixt's catalog; a 2-door convertible is "3" (two side doors + 1 trunk). Treat the value as Sixt-reported, not as a passenger-door count.
- **Mileage policy varies by class.** Most US offers are `Unlimited miles`; some premium SUVs (BMW X3 M50, X5 M60, X7; Cadillac Escalade) show `700 miles included` (with per-mile overage fees not displayed on the card). Surface the string verbatim.
- **Locale auto-detection follows the egress IP.** EN/USD for US, DE/EUR for Germany, etc. Override via the language/currency selector in the header (`button: Change language or currency`). For consistent USD pricing, force a US-egress Browserbase proxy.
- **Footer airport-code link doesn't deep-link to offerlist.** `/car-rental/usa/los-angeles/los-angeles-international-airport/` is a marketing landing page, not a search-prefilled URL. You still need to drive the typeahead from the home page.
- **GraphQL/REST anti-pattern.** All hopeful endpoints — `/php/reservation/locations`, `/php/reservation/branches`, `/api/v3/locations/search` — return `400 Bad Request` or `302 → /`. They exist as routes but reject anything but their internal call shape. Don't probe them.
