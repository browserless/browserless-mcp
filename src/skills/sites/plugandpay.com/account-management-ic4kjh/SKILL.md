# Plug&Pay Customer Portal — Manage Your Account

## Purpose

Reach the Plug&Pay **Customer Portal** — the surface where a buyer/customer of a
Plug&Pay merchant manages their own account: view active subscriptions, download
invoices, edit billing and contact details, change their payment term, and
cancel or resume a subscription. The portal lives at
`https://portal.plugandpay.com/login/{merchant-slug}` and is gated by a
**passwordless magic-link login** (enter email → receive a one-time login link by
email → click it). This skill documents how to reach the portal, drive the login
gate, and recognise each outcome state. It is **read-only**: it does not complete
a login and does not modify, cancel, or resume anything.

> Note on scope: "account management" on Plug&Pay has two distinct surfaces. The
> end-customer **Customer Portal** (this skill) is the only one reachable without
> pre-provisioned merchant credentials. The separate _merchant admin dashboard_
> (Settings > Administration > Users / Customer Portal / Subscription) is behind a
> private merchant login that is not publicly reachable — see Site-Specific
> Gotchas.

## When to Use

- "Log me into my Plug&Pay customer portal to download an invoice."
- "Cancel / pause my subscription with {merchant} that runs on Plug&Pay."
- "Update the billing details on my Plug&Pay-managed subscription."
- An agent that needs to confirm the login mechanism (passwordless magic-link) or
  detect whether a given merchant slug has the Customer Portal enabled.
- Any flow that needs to reach the portal account screen, given the customer can
  supply the magic link / OTP that lands in their own inbox.

## Workflow

The Customer Portal is a JavaScript SPA fronted by Cloudflare. A **residential-proxy
browser session (a residential proxy)** is sufficient — Cloudflare's managed JS challenge
fires (`/cdn-cgi/challenge-platform/...`) but does not block. stealth was not
required in testing. There is no usable public API for login itself (the
`magic-link` endpoint only triggers an email; you still need the inbox), so the
recommended method is the browser.

1. **Open the portal with a residential-proxy session.** The merchant slug is
   required; Plug&Pay's own demo instance uses slug `plugandpay-3`. One
   `browserless_agent` call (no release step — nothing to release; the session
   persists across calls, keyed by `proxy`) with the whole reach-and-inspect flow
   in its `commands` array:
   ```jsonc
   // browserless_agent
   {
     "proxy": { "proxy": "residential", "proxyCountry": "us" },
     "commands": [
       {
         "method": "goto",
         "params": {
           "url": "https://portal.plugandpay.com/login/{merchant-slug}",
           "waitUntil": "load",
           "timeout": 45000,
         },
       },
       { "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 2000 } }, // SPA hydrates ~2s; raw HTML is nearly empty until then
       { "method": "snapshot" },
     ],
   }
   ```
2. **Confirm you're on the login gate.** Expect heading `Login met e-mailadres`
   (Dutch default; "Login with email address"), subtext
   `Op deze manier is zeker dat jij je aanmeldt, en niemand anders.`, a single
   `<input type="email">` (placeholder `info@plugandpay.nl`), a submit button
   `Link versturen` ("Send link"), and a NL/English language switcher. There is
   **no password field** — authentication is passwordless magic-link only.
3. **Request the magic link** (only when the user has asked to log in and a real
   customer email + inbox is available). Because this drives a login gate, first
   load the `autonomous-login` skill (via `browserless_skill`) and follow its
   gates. Batch fill → submit → confirm in ONE `browserless_agent` call to save
   round-trips (repeat the same `proxy` to stay in the same session). A plain email
   address goes in `type` directly; if the email
   lives in a vault, pass it via `loadSecret` rather than inlining it:
   ```jsonc
   // browserless_agent
   {
     "proxy": { "proxy": "residential", "proxyCountry": "us" },
     "commands": [
       {
         "method": "goto",
         "params": {
           "url": "https://portal.plugandpay.com/login/{merchant-slug}",
           "waitUntil": "load",
           "timeout": 45000,
         },
       },
       {
         "method": "waitForSelector",
         "params": { "selector": "input[type=\"email\"]", "timeout": 10000 },
       },
       {
         "method": "type",
         "params": {
           "selector": "input[type=\"email\"]",
           "text": "<customer-email>",
         },
       },
       {
         "method": "click",
         "params": { "selector": "button[type=\"submit\"]" },
       }, // the "Link versturen" button — confirm via snapshot if it misses
       { "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 3000 } },
       { "method": "text", "params": { "selector": "body" } },
     ],
   }
   ```
   - On an **accepted email**, the screen swaps to heading `E-mail verzonden`
     ("Email sent") with body
     `In je mail heb je als je e-mailadres klopte een loginlink ontvangen.
Controleer ook je spam.` ("If your email address was correct you've received
     a login link in your mail. Also check your spam.") and a resend link
     `Niets ontvangen? Probeer het opnieuw.` ("Nothing received? Try again.").
   - On an **unknown / non-customer email**, the underlying
     `POST /magic-link/{slug}` returns **HTTP 422** and the form stays as-is.
4. **Complete login out-of-band.** The customer opens the magic link emailed to
   them. An agent cannot proceed past this gate without inbox access — stop here
   and hand the link/OTP step to the user.
5. **After login (capabilities reference, requires the magic link).** The portal
   lists active subscriptions and exposes, depending on what the merchant enabled
   under their _Customer Portal_ settings: download invoices, edit billing/contact
   details, change payment term (e.g. monthly → annual via the per-subscription
   screen), and cancel/resume a subscription (via the **Actions** button →
   _Cancel_ / _Resume_). Plug&Pay Lite/Premium merchants may have only a subset
   enabled (full portal is a Plug&Pay Ultimate feature; partial on Premium via the
   Huddle link).

**Read-only rule:** do not click _Cancel_, _Resume_, or save edited billing
details. Stop at the account/subscription overview.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **Passwordless only — no password field.** Login is an emailed magic link
  ("Link versturen" / send link). An agent cannot self-serve past the gate without
  access to the target inbox. Don't hunt for a password form; there isn't one.
- **a residential proxy is sufficient; stealth not needed.** Confirmed over two runs:
  a residential-proxy session passes Cloudflare's managed JS challenge
  (`/cdn-cgi/challenge-platform/...` + `/cdn-cgi/rum`). A bare (no-proxy) session
  was not validated — the pre-run probe flagged proxies as likely-needed, so keep
  a residential proxy on.
- **Merchant slug is mandatory in the URL.** The portal is multi-tenant:
  `https://portal.plugandpay.com/login/{merchant-slug}`. Without the slug you can't
  reach a specific merchant's portal. `plugandpay-3` is Plug&Pay's own demo slug
  and is a reliable probe target.
- **`portal.plugandpay.nl` 301-redirects to `portal.plugandpay.com`.** Use the
  `.com` host directly to skip the redirect hop.
- **Default language is Dutch (NL).** Headings/labels are Dutch out of the box
  (`Login met e-mailadres`, `Link versturen`, `E-mail verzonden`). An English
  toggle exists in the footer language switcher. Match on the Dutch strings unless
  you've switched the locale.
- **Email validation is server-side and leaks membership.** `POST /magic-link/{slug}`
  returns **422** for an email that is not a customer of that merchant, but the UI
  also shows a privacy-preserving "if your email was correct…" confirmation. Treat
  a 422 as "email not recognised for this merchant," and the `E-mail verzonden`
  screen as "request accepted."
- **Useful supporting endpoints (not a login bypass):**
  `GET https://api.plugandpay.com/portal/enabled/{slug}` → 200 indicates the portal
  is active for that merchant; `GET https://api.plugandpay.com/v2/countries` → 200
  feeds the billing-address country dropdown. Neither lets you skip the magic link.
- **The page is a hydrate-on-load SPA.** Raw HTML is essentially empty — always
  add a `waitForTimeout` of ~2000 ms (or a `waitForSelector` on the email input)
  before the `snapshot`/`text` command.
- **Query one selector at a time for `text`/`html` commands.** Comma-separated
  selectors (e.g. `form, .login-form`) are rejected. Read a single selector, or
  pass `body` to a `text`/`html` command; better still, fold parsing into an
  `evaluate` that returns a `JSON.stringify` projection.
- **Merchant admin dashboard is out of scope / not publicly reachable.** Account
  actions documented in Plug&Pay's help center as _Settings > Administration_
  (adding users, the merchant's own subscription, enabling the Customer Portal)
  live in a private merchant app, not at any guessable `app.`/`my.`/`dashboard.`
  subdomain (`app.plugandpay.com`, `my.plugandpay.com`, `app.plugandpay.nl`,
  `dashboard.plugandpay.com` all return 404). Don't waste time probing for it; the
  customer-facing portal above is the reachable surface.
