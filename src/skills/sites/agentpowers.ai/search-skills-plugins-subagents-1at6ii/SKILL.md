# AgentPowers Marketplace Search

## Purpose

Search the AgentPowers marketplace for skills, agents (a.k.a. subagents), and plugins built for Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Windsurf, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, and other AI tooling. Returns a list of matching items — for each: slug, title, description, category, type (`skill` or `agent`), price (cents + currency), version, security status, install/download/view counts, average rating, author, and source (native AgentPowers vs. external e.g. ClawHub). Read-only — never purchases or installs.

## When to Use

- A developer or buying agent looking for an existing skill that already implements a task before writing one (e.g. "code review", "testing", "ontology", "github").
- Filtering the marketplace by type (`skill` vs `agent`/subagent), category (`development`, `marketing`, `productivity`, `design`, `sales`, `data`, `security`), or pricing.
- Comparing native AgentPowers listings alongside community-vetted external sources (ClawHub etc.) in one unified search response.
- Discovery flows inside another agent — e.g. a Claude Code session asking "which AgentPowers skill should I install to do X?".

## Workflow

AgentPowers exposes the same search surface through four channels — the public REST API at `https://api.agentpowers.ai/v1/search` is the fastest, no-auth, structured path and is the recommended primary. Three documented alternatives (remote MCP, local CLI `ap search`, and the browser UI at `/skills?q=`) all hit the same backend index; pick whichever fits the caller's context. **Important**: as of 2026-05-19, the backing Railway API host was returning a Railway-edge `X-Railway-Fallback: true` 404 for every path, and the Vercel front-end was correspondingly serving HTTP 500 on `/` and a "Marketplace temporarily unavailable" banner on `/skills` and `/skills?q=…`. Confirm liveness with a cheap probe (`GET /v1/categories` should return 200 JSON) before depending on the search response — see Site-Specific Gotchas.

### 1. Recommended: public REST API (no auth)

```
GET https://api.agentpowers.ai/v1/search
    ?q={query}                  // required, 1–200 chars
    &type={skill|agent}         // optional; omit for both
    &limit={1..100}             // default 20
    &offset={0..}               // default 0
```

Response is a `SectionedSearchResponse`:

```jsonc
{
  "agentpowers": {                // always present — AgentPowers native section
    "items": [ /* SkillSummary[] — see Expected Output */ ],
    "total":  <int>,
    "limit":  <int>,
    "offset": <int>
  },
  // External-source sections (e.g. "clawhub") may appear as additional top-level keys
  // — iterate `Object.keys(response)` rather than hardcoding section names.
}
```

`SkillSummary` always carries `slug`, `title`, `description`, `category`, `type` (`"skill"` or `"agent"`), `price_cents` (0 = free), `currency` (`"USD"`), `version`, `security_status`, `download_count`. Optional fields: `long_description`, `view_count`, `install_count`, `rating_average`, `rating_count`, `author` (object with `display_name`, `github_username`, `display_name_slug`, `avatar_url`, `verified`), and external-source extras (`source`, `source_url`, `source_installs`, `source_stars`).

To enumerate categories before scoping a search, hit `GET https://api.agentpowers.ai/v1/categories` (no params, no auth) — returns `{categories: [{category, name, description, icon, sample_keywords, count}], total_count}`.

**Executing with Browserless.** This is a plain REST call — use it from any HTTP client. If you must route through Browserless (restricted egress), use `browserless_function`; its sandbox runs in a **browser page context**, so `page.goto('https://api.agentpowers.ai/')` first (the browser accepts the host's internally-issued TLS cert that a raw client would reject — see gotchas), then `page.evaluate` a same-origin fetch:

```js
// browserless_function `code`
export default async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://api.agentpowers.ai/', {
    waitUntil: 'domcontentloaded',
    timeout: 30000,
  });
  const data = await page.evaluate(async () => {
    const r = await fetch('/v1/search?q=github&limit=20');
    return await r.json(); // SectionedSearchResponse — iterate Object.keys(), no top-level items[]
  });
  return { data: JSON.stringify(data), type: 'application/json' };
};
```

### 2. Alternative — remote MCP (in-conversation)

Add `https://api.agentpowers.ai/mcp` as a custom integration in claude.ai (Settings → Integrations → Add Custom Integration), then call the `search_marketplace` tool. The MCP server exposes 9 tools; relevant ones for this skill:

- `search_marketplace` — same params as the REST endpoint (`q`, `type`, `limit`, optional category).
- `get_categories` — list categories with live counts.
- `get_skill_details` — full detail for a single slug.

No OAuth needed for these read-only tools. Use this path when the caller is already a claude.ai conversation and doesn't want to make raw HTTP calls.

### 3. Alternative — local CLI (`ap search`)

```bash
npx @agentpowers/cli setup        # one-time, or: pip install agentpowers
ap search "code review"
ap search "testing" --limit 10
ap search "devops" --category development
ap search "agent"  --type agent
```

Returns a unified table sectioned by source. Useful when scripting from a shell or CI. No auth required for `ap search` (only for `install` / `publish`).

### 4. Browser fallback (`/skills?q=`)

When all of the above are unreachable but the Vercel front-end is up:

1. Open `https://agentpowers.ai/skills?q={URL-encoded query}`. The page title becomes `Search: "{query}" | AgentPowers` and the `<meta name="sentry-route-name" content="/skills">` confirms server-side rendering of the search route. The query param `q=` is read by the Astro Island that powers the results list.
2. The same page also supports `type=skill|agent` (also reachable at `/agents?q=…` for the agents-only view), category scoping (`/skills/{category}` — e.g. `/skills/development`), and the `All Pricing` / `All Categories` / `Most Downloads` filter buttons.
3. The header has a global combobox (`aria-label: Search skills and agents`) that drives the same search but renders an autocomplete dropdown over whatever page you are on.
4. To extract listings from a rendered results page with `browserless_agent`: `goto` the `/skills?q=` URL (`waitUntil:"load"`), `waitForTimeout` ~2000 for the Astro island to hydrate, then `evaluate` a scrape of the result cards (`main article`) — or read `text` on `main` and detect the `Marketplace temporarily unavailable` heading. A working response renders `<article>` cards inside `main`; the unavailable state shows that heading (with a "Refresh" link). See Site-Specific Gotchas for disambiguating "0 results" from "API down".

```jsonc
"commands": [
  { "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "https://agentpowers.ai/skills?q=code%20review", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } },
  { "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 2000 } },
  { "method": "evaluate", "params": { "content": "(()=>{const down=document.body.innerText.includes('Marketplace temporarily unavailable');const cards=[...document.querySelectorAll('main article')].map(a=>a.innerText.trim().replace(/\\s+/g,' '));return JSON.stringify({down,count:cards.length,cards});})()" } }
]
```

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **Outage signature observed 2026-05-19**: the Railway-hosted API (`api.agentpowers.ai`) was returning `X-Railway-Edge: railway/us-west2` + `X-Railway-Fallback: true` 404 HTML on every path (including `/`, `/v1/categories`, `/v1/search`, `/.well-known/api-catalog`, `/mcp`). The Vercel front-end (`agentpowers.ai`) returned HTTP 500 on `/`, and `/skills` / `/skills?q=…` / `/agents` rendered the page chrome with the heading "Marketplace temporarily unavailable" and the paragraph "Please try again in a moment." Both API and browser paths are down together when the Railway backend is unprovisioned — there is no separate fallback datastore. Probe with `GET https://api.agentpowers.ai/v1/categories` and treat a 4xx/5xx as "down across all surfaces"; retry with exponential backoff. **Do not assume** the browser will succeed when the API fails.
- **`api.agentpowers.ai` ships an internally-issued TLS cert that a strict HTTP client rejects.** A real browser accepts it, so the `browserless_function` path (which fetches from a page context after `page.goto`) and `browserless_agent` navigation both work without any insecure-SSL flag. If you call the API from a raw client instead, you may need to allow the self-signed cert.
- **The combobox in the header does not navigate on Enter when the API is down** — typing into `[combobox: Search skills and agents]` shows the typed text but produces no autocomplete dropdown until results arrive. Use the URL form `/skills?q={query}` directly instead of the combobox; the URL param is the canonical entry point.
- **Search is sectioned by source, not flat**. The REST response always has an `agentpowers` key, plus zero or more external-source keys (e.g. `clawhub`). Iterate `Object.keys(response)` rather than only reading `response.items` — there is no top-level `items` array. The CLI surfaces the same shape ("Results are sectioned by source — AgentPowers native skills appear first, followed by external sources like ClawHub").
- **`type` is restricted to `skill` or `agent` (regex `^(skill|agent)$`)**. There is no "plugin" enum value despite the marketplace UI calling the Codex/Claude installers "plugins" — plugins (`/codex-plugin`, `/claude-extension`) are installation surfaces, not catalog item types. Search for plugins by name (e.g. `q=codex`) and read `type` per result.
- **"Subagent" is just the marketing word for `type=agent`** — agents are the AgentPowers term for a full agent package, distinguished in the API by `type:"agent"` and surfaced under `/agents` in the UI. There is no separate `subagent` filter.
- **The `pricing` and `sort` controls visible in the UI (`All Pricing`, `Most Downloads`) are not documented in `/v1/search`** — the OpenAPI lists only `q`, `type`, `limit`, `offset`. The Vercel front-end applies pricing/sort client-side after fetching from the same endpoint, so filtering by free vs. paid means inspecting `price_cents === 0` on each `SkillSummary` and sorting on `download_count`/`view_count` yourself.
- **External-source items (e.g. ClawHub) carry `source`, `source_url`, `source_installs`, `source_stars`** — surface these to the caller so they can disambiguate "AgentPowers native" from "external, security-scanned passthrough". External skills go through the same 9-layer security pipeline before listing, but the install path differs (sandboxed re-scan on install).
- **`price_cents` is an integer**; AgentPowers charges a 15% platform fee with a $5 minimum on paid skills. `price_cents=0` ⇒ free skill. `currency` has always been `USD` in observed responses.
- **The `/agents` listing endpoint returned "No agents found" on 2026-05-19** while `/skills` returned the outage banner — different SSR error handling paths, same root cause. "No agents found" does not always mean an empty catalog; treat it as ambiguous when paired with a failing `api.agentpowers.ai` probe.
- **`docs.agentpowers.ai/llms.txt`** is the canonical index of every API endpoint and guide. Fetch it once at session start if you need to discover endpoints you don't know; every endpoint also has a `.md` variant at the same URL (e.g. `…/search/search-marketplace.md`) that returns clean markdown + the embedded OpenAPI block. This is the cheapest way to refresh endpoint shapes without scraping HTML.
- **MCP-server installation surface** is `https://api.agentpowers.ai/mcp` (Streamable HTTP, primary) and `https://api.agentpowers.ai/mcp/sse` (legacy SSE). Both are also offline when the Railway host is down.
- **OAuth is not needed for search**. The `/v1/search`, `/v1/categories`, `/v1/skills/{slug}`, `/v1/agents/{slug}`, and equivalent MCP tools are all unauthenticated. Auth (Clerk JWT or OAuth-issued Bearer) is only required for write paths and personalized reads (`/v1/me`, `/v1/purchases`).
- **Rate limits** (per the published rate-limits guide): public endpoints are bucketed by IP. Use `limit=100&offset=N` to paginate rather than firing parallel queries; respect 429 `Retry-After` if returned.
