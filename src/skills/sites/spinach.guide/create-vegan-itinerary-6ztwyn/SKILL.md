# Create Vegan Food Itinerary

## Purpose

Build a day-by-day vegan-food itinerary for a city covered by spinach.guide by synthesizing the site's Top Picks (Essentials), signature-dish rankings, dietary-core lists, and meal-occasion buckets (breakfast / lunch & brunch / dinner / sweet treats / etc.) into a structured plan for an arbitrary number of days, weighted against user-supplied constraints — preferences, allergies, cravings, price band, vegan-only vs. omni-friendly, and any anchor neighborhoods from an existing travel itinerary. Read-only; never books, reserves, or contacts a venue.

## When to Use

- A user is traveling to one of the 158 ranked spinach.guide cities for N days and wants a meal-by-meal plan grounded in current rankings, not generic listicles.
- A user wants the plan filtered by hard constraints (gluten-free, nut allergy, soy-free) and soft preferences (Japanese cravings, $$ budget, walkable from Mission Bay, kid-friendly only).
- A user is staying in a specific neighborhood / has a fixed day-by-day location plan and wants meal stops bucketed closest to where they'll be each day.
- A user wants a "best of" weekend (2 days) vs. a deeper week-long (7 days) tour, and expects later days to dig past the obvious 15 essentials into hidden gems and dish-specific #1s.

## Workflow

The site is a static Astro build behind Cloudflare with **no anti-bot, no auth, no JS gating, and no JSON API** — every page renders the full dataset server-side. The fastest path is a single `browserless_agent` call that navigates the predictable URL slug and parses the rendered body in-page. Point it at the slug with a `goto` command (`waitUntil: "load"`), then either `evaluate` to parse the cards / "On this page" nav / any LD-JSON directly, or (for cleaner extraction) a `text` command over `main`/`body` — one call does the whole fetch-and-parse. No proxy and no stealth flag are required — the site does not challenge or interrogate sessions, confirmed against 5+ cities on iter-1. (The site does block `Bytespider`, `CCBot`, and `meta-externalagent` in `robots.txt` but allows everything else; a real browser page load is unaffected.)

There is **no `/api/cities/...` endpoint** (returns 404). Everything is in the rendered HTML. Treat each page slug as the API.

**Not every city has every category.** Smaller cities (e.g. Wellington, York) typically lack `work-friendly`, `hidden-gems`, or `worth-the-occasion`. Probe the sitemap or read the "On this page" nav of the city overview to confirm which sections exist before fetching. Hitting a missing category returns a 404 HTML page (custom Spinach 404, not an error envelope).

### Steps

1. **Resolve the city slug.** Lowercase, hyphenated, no diacritics: `san-francisco`, `new-york-city`, `ho-chi-minh-city`, `los-angeles`. If the user gives a city name, slugify it; if uncertain, `GET /sitemap-0.xml` and grep for `/cities/{candidate}/` — the sitemap is the source of truth.

2. **Fetch the city overview** (`/cities/{slug}/`). This single page is enough for a 1–2 day itinerary and gives you the full set of available category slugs for that city (read the "On this page" nav links to know what exists). Extract:
   - Intro paragraph (city's signature cuisine angle — e.g. "San Francisco leans Japanese ramen on signatures with 18 venues serving it")
   - Top 15 Essentials list (each card: rank, venue-slug, name, ★ rating, A–E grade, $ price band, distance-from-centre, cuisine description, one-line tip, dish rank badge if applicable e.g. `#1 FOR RAMEN IN SAN FRANCISCO`)
   - Signature dish sections (e.g. Best Ramen — top 4 venues per dish)
   - Fully Vegan / Omni Standouts (top 4 of each)
   - Each meal-occasion section's top 4

3. **Fetch deeper category lists for longer itineraries.** For 3+ days, also `GET` the explicit `/breakfast-spots/`, `/lunch-brunch/`, `/dinner-destinations/`, `/sweet-treats/` pages — they return up to ~8 venues each with full at-a-glance metadata, today's hours, and the same one-line tips. For 5+ days, add `/hidden-gems/` and any signature dish sub-rankings (`/best/{dish}/{city}/`) the user is craving.

4. **Optional venue-detail enrichment.** If the user asks for hours, address, lat/lon, or must-try dishes per stop, `GET /venues/{venue-slug}/` for each shortlisted venue. The page exposes:
   - Spinach rating breakdown (food / service / atmosphere)
   - Vegan friendliness grade (A–E) — `A` = clearly labeled, knowledgeable staff, abundant options; `E` = one sad salad
   - Full weekly hours
   - Address + Google Maps directions URL with embedded `destination={lat},{lon}` — parse this to get coordinates for distance/cluster math
   - "Popular tips" (5 bullets of crowd wisdom)
   - "Must-try" dishes with popularity counts (e.g. `breaded oyster mushrooms — popular (×15)`)
   - "Praised for" attribute tags (cozy atmosphere ×19, friendly service ×14)
   - Tags: `Date Night`, `Dinner`, `Drinks`, `Small Groups`, `Special Occasion`, `Outdoor Seating`, etc.
   - External Google Maps rating (sanity-check)

5. **Apply user constraints.** Run the candidate venue pool through the constraint stack in this order (each is a filter or a re-rank, not a hard cut unless the user marks it strict):

   | Constraint type                   | Field on the venue card                                       | Filter rule                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
   | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | Hard allergies (gluten, nut, soy) | "Must-try" dishes + cuisine description                       | Drop venues whose only highlighted dishes contradict the allergy (e.g. drop dedicated bakeries for gluten-free; drop tofu-heavy spots for soy allergy). When the venue page has no contradicting signal, keep but flag.              |
   | Vegan-only strict                 | "Fully plant-based" badge or `/fully-vegan/` membership       | Drop venues not in fully-vegan list.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
   | Price band                        | `$`, `$$`, `$$$`, `$$$$`                                      | Drop venues outside the band.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
   | Cuisine cravings                  | Cuisine string + dish rank badges                             | Re-rank: boost venues with a `#1 FOR {craving}` badge to top of their slot.                                                                                                                                                          |
   | Neighborhood / day-anchor         | `distance from centre` (km) on cards; lat/lon on venue page   | When the user supplies an anchor (e.g. "we're in Mission Bay on day 2"), prefer venues with distance bands compatible with the anchor or geocode each candidate via the venue-page Maps URL and pick by haversine ≤ 2km from anchor. |
   | Family / date-night / group       | Venue-page tag chips (`Date Night`, `Special Occasion`, etc.) | Match the night's intent to the tag.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
   | A–E grade floor                   | VFI grade letter on card                                      | Drop below user's floor (default keep A–C, drop D/E unless they have a #1 dish rank).                                                                                                                                                |

6. **Slot venues into the itinerary skeleton.** Per day, fill four slots in this priority order, drawing from the filtered pool without repeating venues. Stop earlier if user requested fewer meals/day.

   ```
   Day N:
     Breakfast        ← /breakfast-spots/ pool, weighted by today's hours
     Lunch            ← /lunch-brunch/ ∪ /essentials/ (lunch-open) ∪ signature-dish #1s
     Coffee / Sweet   ← /sweet-treats/ (only if user opts in)
     Dinner           ← /dinner-destinations/ ∪ /worth-the-occasion/ (for "special" night) ∪ /essentials/ (dinner-open)
   ```

   **Diversification rule**: don't put two venues with the same dish-rank category on the same day (e.g. two ramen spots), and try to vary cuisine across the trip. Days 1–2 should weight toward Top 15 Essentials; days 3+ rotate in hidden gems, dish-#1s, and worth-the-occasion picks. End on a `Worth the Occasion` dinner if the trip is 3+ days.

7. **Emit the itinerary as structured JSON** (see Expected Output) with rationale strings citing the source page slug for each pick, so the user/agent can verify the recommendation against spinach.guide.

### Extraction variant (cleaner body copy)

The default `evaluate` parse is the leanest path. If the `evaluate` projection ever misses (e.g. Cloudflare temporarily reshapes the markup, or you just want pre-cleaned prose for synthesis) — none observed in testing — swap the extraction command on the same `browserless_agent` call for a `text` command over `main` instead of an `evaluate`:

```
browserless_agent commands:
  { "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "https://spinach.guide/cities/{slug}/", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } }
  { "method": "text", "params": { "selector": "main" } }   # cleaner than raw HTML for synthesis
```

No proxy and no stealth flag are needed; the site does not interrogate sessions. This is the same ephemeral browser session as the primary path, just a different extraction command — not a separate long-lived session.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **No JSON API**: `/api/cities/...` and any obvious REST shape return a custom 404 page. The Astro build emits the full dataset into rendered HTML/markdown — that _is_ the API. Do not waste turns probing for `/api/*`, `/graphql`, or Supabase endpoints (the embedded Supabase client is only used client-side for photo-failure telemetry; it does not serve venue data).
- **The site is Cloudflare-fronted but does not challenge bots**: a plain `browserless_agent` `goto` (no proxy, no stealth flag) returns 200s consistently — no `solve` step is ever needed. `robots.txt` allows `User-agent: *` except `Bytespider`, `CCBot`, `meta-externalagent`. Keep request rate ≤ 1–2 req/s out of courtesy; no rate-limit observed below that.
- **Category slug coverage is non-uniform across cities**: Larger cities (SF, NYC, London, Berlin, LA) have all 11 sub-category pages; smaller cities (Wellington, York, Zurich) typically expose only 6–8 (commonly miss `work-friendly`, `hidden-gems`, and sometimes `worth-the-occasion`). Always read the "On this page" nav on `/cities/{slug}/` before fetching sub-paths, or grep the sitemap. Hitting a missing category returns a custom 404 HTML page (not a JSON error).
- **Slug variants for multi-word cities**: `new-york-city` (not `new-york`), `los-angeles`, `san-francisco`, `ho-chi-minh-city`, `tel-aviv`. When in doubt, fetch `/sitemap-0.xml` (one file, ~250KB) and substring-match.
- **Distance is from the city centre, not from the user**: Every card shows `X km from centre` — this is centroid-relative, not user-relative. For neighborhood-anchored itineraries, you must geocode the user's anchor and the venue's lat/lon (from the venue page's `https://www.google.com/maps/dir/?api=1&destination={lat},{lon}` URL) and compute haversine yourself.
- **Vegan Friendliness Index (VFI) grade ≠ Spinach rating**: A venue can be `★ 5.0` (outstanding food) and `D` graded (limited vegan options) — the 5-star rating reflects the food's actual quality, the A–E grade reflects vegan-friendliness (options count, protein sources, menu clarity, staff knowledge). For a vegan-only audience, treat the grade as the primary filter and the star rating as the tie-breaker.
- **"Fully plant-based" badge is the strict-vegan signal**: When a venue card shows this badge or appears in `/cities/{slug}/fully-vegan/`, the kitchen has no animal products. Omni-standout venues require asking and may carry cross-contamination risk; flag these when the user has a strict-vegan stance.
- **Dish-rank badges (`#1 FOR RAMEN IN SAN FRANCISCO`) only appear on cards in cities where that dish has ≥ a handful of contenders.** If a user craves a dish not surfaced in the city's signature sections, check `/best/{dish}/{city}/` directly — the per-dish page exists even when it didn't make the city's signature shortlist.
- **Today's hours on category-list pages reflect the page's CDN cache time, not real-time.** They're refreshed daily ("last refreshed today" banner); for time-of-day-sensitive plans (Sunday brunch, late-night dinner), open the venue page for the full weekly schedule rather than trusting the list card.
- **Venue slugs are stable but contain numeric suffixes** (e.g. `aiso-124450`, `the-butterfly-joint-2421`). Don't try to construct them — always lift them from anchor `href`s on the city/category page.
- **Photos lazy-fail through a failover chain**: The page embeds `data-fallbacks="..."` per `<img>` and reports broken photos back to Supabase. This is a UI concern only — has no impact on data extraction.
- **`/best/{dish}/` (city-omitted) is a cross-city dish ranking**, not a global venue list — useful only when the user wants to compare cities for a specific dish, not for itinerary building within one city.
- **159 cities ≠ 158 cities**: The homepage advertises 158 cities; the actual sitemap count drifts daily as cities are added. The "All N cities" link in the homepage is the live count. Don't hardcode.
