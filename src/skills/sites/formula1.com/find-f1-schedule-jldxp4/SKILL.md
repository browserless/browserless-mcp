      The race page server-renders the full schedule as structured JSON
      (race.meetingSessions) plus a schema.org JSON-LD subEvent array. A single
      HTTP GET returns track-local times with timezone + gmtOffset — no scripted

      Works but is strictly worse: a OneTrust cookie modal overlays the page,
      rendered times default to the viewer's 'My time' timezone (must toggle
      'Track time'), and the schedule lives in a non-window scroll container.

# F1 Race Weekend Schedule

## Purpose

Retrieve the complete session schedule for a single Formula 1 Grand Prix from `formula1.com` — every Free Practice, Qualifying, Sprint Qualifying, Sprint and the Race — each with its date, start time, end time, timezone and GMT offset. This is a **read-only** lookup. The recommended path is a plain HTTP `fetch` of the canonical race page, which server-renders the full schedule as structured JSON; no scripted browsing is required.

## When to Use

- A user asks "what time is qualifying / the race / FP1 for the {country} Grand Prix?"
- A user wants the full weekend running order and timings for an upcoming or past race.
- You have an F1 news/article URL (e.g. `.../article/formula-1-lenovo-austrian-grand-prix-2026...`) and need to resolve it to the actual session timetable.
- You need machine-readable session times (with explicit timezone/offset) to build a calendar, countdown, or reminder.

## Workflow

The schedule is embedded twice in the server-rendered HTML of every race page. **Fetch the page once and parse the embedded JSON — do not drive a browser.**

The canonical race page URL is:

```
https://www.formula1.com/en/racing/{year}/{race-slug}
```

1. **Resolve the race slug.** Slugs are country/location based and not always obvious (e.g. Monza → `italy`, Imola → `emilia-romagna`, Abu Dhabi → `united-arab-emirates`, Las Vegas → `las-vegas`, Spielberg/Red Bull Ring → `austria`). To map a race name reliably, fetch the season index and read the `/en/racing/{year}/{slug}` links (each card carries the round number and country name):

   ```json
   {
     "commands": [
       {
         "method": "goto",
         "params": {
           "url": "https://www.formula1.com/en/racing/2026",
           "waitUntil": "load",
           "timeout": 45000
         }
       },
       {
         "method": "evaluate",
         "params": {
           "content": "(()=>{ const h=document.documentElement.outerHTML; return JSON.stringify([...new Set(h.match(/\\/en\\/racing\\/2026\\/[a-z0-9-]+/g)||[])]); })()"
         }
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

   If you were handed an article URL instead of a race name, that article page also links directly to its `/en/racing/{year}/{slug}` race page — fetch the article and extract the link.

2. **Load the race page** — a plain `browserless_agent` call works (HTTP 200, no proxy/stealth, no anti-bot). Navigate, then parse the embedded JSON in an `evaluate` (step 3) so you return only the projected sessions, not the whole HTML.

3. **Parse the embedded `race.meetingSessions` array** — this is the preferred source because it gives **track-local** times directly plus an explicit `timezone` and `gmtOffset` (no UTC conversion needed). Read the SSR HTML in-page (reading the live `outerHTML` skips the `\"`→`"` unescaping the old JSON envelope needed):

   ```js
   // body of an evaluate command on the race page
   const html = document.documentElement.outerHTML;
   const i = html.indexOf('"meetingSessions":[');
   const start = html.indexOf('[', i);
   let d = 0,
     end = -1;
   for (let k = start; k < html.length; k++) {
     const c = html[k];
     if (c === '[') d++;
     else if (c === ']') {
       d--;
       if (!d) {
         end = k;
         break;
       }
     }
   }
   const arr = JSON.parse(html.slice(start, end + 1));
   return JSON.stringify(
     arr.map((x) => ({
       shortName: x.shortName,
       description: x.description,
       startTime: x.startTime,
       gmtOffset: x.gmtOffset,
       timezone: x.timezone,
       state: x.state,
     })),
   );
   ```

   Each item has: `session`, `shortName` (FP1/FP2/FP3/Sprint Q/Sprint/Qualifying/Race), `description`, `startTime`, `endTime` (both track-local, no offset suffix), `gmtOffset` (e.g. `+02:00`), `timezone` (IANA, e.g. `Europe/Vienna`), `state` (`upcoming`/`completed`), and `sessionType`. Compose an ISO-8601 instant by appending `gmtOffset` to `startTime`/`endTime`.

   Race-level metadata (also in the HTML) gives the official name and location: `meetingOfficialName`, `meetingName`, `meetingLocation`, `meetingCountryCode`, `meetingStartDate`.

4. **Return all sessions.** A conventional weekend has 5 (FP1, FP2, FP3, Qualifying, Race); a Sprint weekend has 5 with a different mix (FP1, Sprint Q, Sprint, Qualifying, Race — only one practice).

### Browser fallback

Only if you cannot run an HTTP fetch. Open `https://www.formula1.com/en/racing/{year}/{slug}` in a stealth-capable session, then:

1. Dismiss the **OneTrust cookie consent modal** — it renders inside an `iframe`, so a top-level `getElementById('onetrust-accept-btn-handler')` will **not** find it. Either click the button inside the iframe via a frame-aware click, or remove the overlay nodes (`[id*=onetrust]`, `[class*=ot-sdk]`, the consent `iframe`) before interacting.
2. Click the **"Track time"** toggle (top-right of the schedule block). By default the page shows **"My time"** — the _viewer's_ timezone — so without toggling you'll capture the wrong times. The remote browser's clock is typically UTC, so "My time" shows times 2h off from track-local.
3. The schedule list sits in a scroll container ~`y=910px`; `window.scrollTo(0, 815)` brings it into the viewport for a clean screenshot/extraction.

Even here, prefer reading the embedded JSON (`{ "method": "text", "params": { "selector": "body" } }` exposes the JSON-LD; the SSR HTML still contains `meetingSessions`) over scraping the rendered DOM rows.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **The race page only lists the main F1 sessions.** Supporting-series timings (F2, F3, Porsche Supercup) are **NOT** on the F1.com race page — the page merely links out to `fiaformula2.com` / `fiaformula3.com`. If a user explicitly needs support-race times, state that F1.com does not publish them and point to those external sites. Don't hunt for an F2/F3 session array in the payload — it isn't there.
- **Two embedded data sources, different timezones.** `race.meetingSessions` gives **track-local** `startTime`/`endTime` + `gmtOffset` + IANA `timezone`. The schema.org JSON-LD `subEvent[]` (under `@type:"SportsEvent"`) gives `startDate`/`endDate` in **UTC** (`...Z`) and needs converting. Prefer `meetingSessions` to avoid conversion bugs.
- **`sessionType` is mislabeled on Sprint weekends.** The field is offset by one: "Sprint Q" carries `sessionType:"Sprint Shootout"` and "Sprint" carries `sessionType:"Sprint Qualifying"`. Trust `shortName`/`description`, not `sessionType`.
- **"My time" vs "Track time" toggle** (browser path only). Rendered times default to the viewer's timezone. Confirmed: with a UTC browser, Practice 1 shows `04:30` under "My time" but the true track-local time is `13:30` (Europe/Vienna). The embedded JSON is always track-local — another reason to prefer fetch.
- **Slugs are not the GP common name.** Use the season index (`/en/racing/{year}`) to map a race to its slug; don't guess (Monza→`italy`, Imola→`emilia-romagna`, Abu Dhabi→`united-arab-emirates`, Barcelona→`barcelona-catalunya`). Pre-season tests appear as `pre-season-testing-1/-2`.
- **No anti-bot.** A plain `browserless_agent` load returns HTTP 200 on the homepage, season index, and race pages **without** any proxy or stealth. The site is a Next.js/CloudFront app (`s-maxage=60` edge cache). Proxies are unnecessary for this read-only task.
- **`state` reflects completion.** Past sessions show `state:"completed"`, future ones `state:"upcoming"` — useful for "what's next" queries.

## Expected Output

Conventional weekend (5 sessions). Times are track-local; `gmtOffset` appended to form an absolute instant:

Sprint weekend (e.g. China, Miami) — same shape, different session set (single practice, plus Sprint Qualifying + Sprint):

```json
