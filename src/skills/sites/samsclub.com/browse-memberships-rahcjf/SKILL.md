      There is no dedicated tier-listing API endpoint on Sam's Club's developer
      portal. The /join page is server-rendered with all tier names, prices,
      benefits, and promo copy embedded as inline JSON, so an HTTP GET on that
      URL is functionally an API and is the recommended path.
  - method: browser
    rationale: >-
      Browser fallback works but is ~100× slower and can surface a 'Press &
      Hold' CAPTCHA overlay on initial load. The overlay is cosmetic — a
      text/html read reads the populated DOM through it — so the browser path is
      still functional, just unnecessary when HTTP fetch succeeds.

# Sam's Club Membership Browser

## Purpose

Return the consumer membership tiers Sam's Club currently sells — `Club` and `Plus` — along with each tier's standard annual price, current promotional first-year price (when a promo is running), promo window dates, and the full benefits list for each tier. Read-only; never clicks "Join", never enters payment info, never creates an account. The output is a single JSON object listing both tiers and the active promo window (if any).

## When to Use

- A research / monitoring agent comparing warehouse-club memberships (Sam's Club vs. Costco vs. BJ's).
- A budget-tracking agent surfacing the user's renewal cost vs. the cheapest current new-member promo.
- A price-tracking agent watching for promo windows ("Save $35 on Club / $65 on Plus" / etc.) and alerting when a new promo opens or the headline savings change.
- Any flow that needs the tier list + benefits without booking. Joining is a separate flow that requires payment + a household member's identity — out of scope here.

## Workflow

The `https://www.samsclub.com/join` page is **fully server-rendered**: the membership tier names, prices, benefits, and promo copy are all embedded as inline JSON inside the response HTML. An HTTP `GET` of this single URL is the recommended path — no JS execution, no auth, no cookies, no anti-bot challenge on the HTTP layer. The interactive browser flow does occasionally surface a "Press & Hold" CAPTCHA overlay, but the underlying DOM populates regardless and a `text`/`html` read (or an `evaluate` returning `document.body.innerText`) reads cleanly through it — so the browser fallback is still functional, just slower.

### 1. HTTP fetch (recommended)

```
GET https://www.samsclub.com/join
```

No headers required beyond a default User-Agent. Returns ~120 KB of HTML on a 200 status in ≤ 1 s. From any agent runtime that can do outbound HTTPS, plain `curl` / `fetch` / `requests` works. From a restricted-egress runtime, use a `browserless_agent` `goto` + `html` (or a `browserless_function` that navigates to the page and returns `document.documentElement.outerHTML`) — residential proxy is **not required**; the URL is not geo-locked or IP-throttled at the HTTP layer.

### 2. Extract the four numeric prices

The HTML contains two distinct price-bearing JSON blocks per tier. Grep / regex on these exact tokens:

| Marker                                                                            | Meaning                                                   |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `"price":"$50/year","title":"Club"`                                               | Club standard annual (renewal) price                      |
| `"price":"$110/year","title":"Plus"`                                              | Plus standard annual (renewal) price                      |
| `<s>$60</s><br><b>$25/first year</b>` (also as `<s>$60</s><br><b>$25/first year`) | Club promo: struck-through "was" + first-year promo price |
| `<s>$120</s><br><b>$55/first year</b>` (likewise unicode-escaped variant)         | Plus promo: struck-through "was" + first-year promo price |

Both the literal `<s>…</s>` HTML form and the unicode-escaped `<s>` form appear in the same response (the HTML version in rendered markup, the unicode form inside the JSON-config block). Match either.

Headline promo savings copy:

```
For a Limited Time: Save $65 on Plus or $35 on Club
```

→ `Save $35 on Club` ⇒ Club savings = $35, `Save $65 on Plus`⇒ Plus savings = $65. Cross-check that`was_price − promo_price` equals the headline savings (`$60 − $25 = $35`, `$120 − $55 = $65`). If they don't match, the promo has changed since this skill was authored — emit what you found and flag the mismatch in `error_reasoning`.

### 3. Extract the benefits list

Each benefit row is rendered inside a `benefits-comparison-grid` block. Look for repeated objects of the shape:

```json
{
  "benefit": "Free Shipping on Orders Over $50",
  "clubBenefitEligibility": "false",
  "clubBenefitExtraDescription": "...",
  "plusBenefitEligibility": "true",
  "plusBenefitExtraDescription": "Plus members receive free shipping on eligible orders over $50."
}
```

`clubBenefitEligibility` / `plusBenefitEligibility` are stringified booleans (`"true"`/`"false"`) — parse accordingly. Standard rows observed:

| Benefit                                         | Club        | Plus                    |

| Tire & Battery Center Savings (50% off install) | ✗           | ✓                       |

Do not hardcode this table — re-parse from the response each run. New benefits get added (e.g., the Mastercard cashback rates have rotated historically) and Plus-only rows occasionally migrate to all-tier as promotions expire.

### 4. Promo-window dates

Promo period appears in legal-disclaimer copy like "Must join as a new member between May 14, 2026 and June 15, 2026 …". Extract with a regex over the response body — `between ([A-Z][a-z]+ \d{1,2},? \d{4}) and ([A-Z][a-z]+ \d{1,2},? \d{4})`. If the promo has expired or no promo block is present, set `promo: null` in the output and use the standard prices ($50/$110) as the only price quoted per tier.

### Browser fallback

Use only when the HTTP path is unavailable (network restrictions in the calling runtime, or the inline JSON shape has changed and a structural re-render is needed for inspection):

A single `browserless_agent` call (residential proxy), all commands in one call so the session persists:

```json
{ "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "https://www.samsclub.com/join", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } }
{ "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 3000 } }
// Don't snapshot — if the Press & Hold overlay is present, snapshot returns
// only ~30 refs (all on the overlay). Read the underlying DOM directly:
{ "method": "html", "params": { "selector": "body" } }
// or an evaluate returning document.body.innerText. Parse the returned text/HTML
// the same way as step 2 above — the prices, benefits table, and promo dates all
// appear in the rendered content even when the CAPTCHA overlay covers them visually.
```

No session-release step — there is nothing to release (the session persists across calls, keyed by its `proxy`/`profile` config; it does not die on return).

Do **not** click the "Join Plus" / "Join Club" buttons. Do **not** "Press & Hold" the CAPTCHA — even if it grants navigation, the next page is a payment funnel. Read-only stops at the comparison table.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **Two price-shapes per tier in the same response, and they disagree.** The promo "was" price ($60 Club / $120 Plus) does not equal the standard renewal price ($50 Club / $110 Plus). Both numbers are real and both come from Sam's Club's own data. The $50 / $110 figures are the ongoing annual price tagged `"price":"$50/year","title":"Club"` (and the Plus equivalent) — these are the right numbers to surface as `annual_price_usd`. The $60 / $120 figures appear only inside the strike-through marketing card and represent Sam's "regular new-member rate" (likely the pre-promo MSRP). When a user asks "what does Sam's Club cost?", report $50 / $110 and call out the $25 / $55 promo as a discount off that, not off the $60 / $120 strike-through.
- **Promo dates are in disclaimer text, not in a dedicated field.** Sam's doesn't expose `promo_start_at` / `promo_end_at` as structured data. The only machine-readable form is the natural-language phrase "Must join as a new member between {start_date} and {end_date}" inside the fine-print block. Date-parse from that.
- **"Press & Hold" CAPTCHA appears on the browser path, never on the HTTP path.** Verified across two sessions — the first residential-proxy `browserless_agent` session surfaced the "Robot or human?" press-and-hold modal on initial load; the second session loaded clean. The HTTP fetch never sees it. **The CAPTCHA overlay is purely cosmetic** — the underlying DOM populates fully under it, so a `text`/`html` command (or an `evaluate` returning `document.body.innerText`) reads through it. `snapshot` does not — it returns ~30 refs all belonging to the overlay itself. Use `text`/`html`/`evaluate` to read through CAPTCHA states.
- **Give the page a beat before the first `snapshot`/read on this site.** Interleave the `goto` (`waitUntil: "load"`) then a `waitForTimeout` of ~3000ms before the first `snapshot`/`text` — the first second after navigation the CDP target is being swapped and an immediate `snapshot` can error out (`-32001 Session with given id not found`), whereas `goto` → wait → read succeeds.
- **The page fetch works without a proxy.** Sam's Club is not blocking the default egress, so the residential-proxy round-trip cost is wasted on this URL. Verified two consecutive 200 OK responses, ~118 KB, with `Akamai-Grn` headers present (so the CDN is in front but is letting the request through).
- **Direct `curl` from the build sandbox was firewall-blocked.** DNS resolution failed (`curl: (6) Could not resolve host: www.samsclub.com`). The build sandbox only allowed outbound HTTP via the Browserless page path (which exits through Browserless egress). This is a property of the **sandbox**, not the site — agents on normal infra can `curl` the URL directly.
- **The page is geo-personalized but the data we care about is not.** Response cookies include `assortmentStoreId=<NNNN>` and a `locDataV3` blob that encodes the inferred user club / city (Atlanta GA or Dallas TX in our two fetches — depends on the egress IP). Membership prices and benefits do not vary by geography in any of the responses observed. Ignore the geo block.
- **No public membership API.** The Sam's Club Developer Portal exposes APIs for orders / shoppingcart / location, but does not have a "list membership tiers / prices" endpoint. The inline JSON inside `/join` is the canonical machine-readable surface for this data.
- **Walmart cookies are shared.** The response sets `AID` on `.walmart.com` and `ACID` on `.samsclub.com` — both are the Walmart inc. ad/identity cookies. If you're chaining HTTP fetches to walmart.com in the same session, expect cookie cross-pollination.
- **Sam's Mastercard cashback rates are inside the page text and change.** As of the converged run: 5% Sam's Cash on gas (first $6,000/yr), 3% dining, 1% other; Club members earn 1% in-club, Plus members earn 3% in-club. These numbers have rotated historically — always re-parse from the response, never hardcode.

When no promo is active, set `active_promo: null` and omit `regular_new_member_price_usd` / `promo_first_year_price_usd` / `promo_savings_usd` from each tier (or set them to `null`). When parsing fails or the page shape has changed, set `success: false` and put the failure reason in `error_reasoning`.
