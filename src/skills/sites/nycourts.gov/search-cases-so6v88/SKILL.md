# Search NY State Unified Court System (eCourts) Dockets

## Purpose

Search the New York State Unified Court System (UCS) eCourts docket surfaces —
WebCivil Supreme, WebCivil Local (NYC Civil / Housing / Town & Village),
WebCriminal, and WebFamily — and return matching cases as structured JSON.
Supports five input shapes (index number, party name, attorney name + filing
dates, criminal docket number, or a direct eCourts URL) and returns per-case
details: index/docket number, court, caption, case type, filing/disposition
dates, status, assigned judge, attorneys, parties, appearance/motion history,
NYSCEF case id + document-list URL, and the canonical case-detail URL.

**Read-only.** Never file a motion, pay a fee, or submit any NYSCEF form.

> **Status: candidate / blocked.** Every public eCourts search form submit is
> gated by a hard **hCaptcha** (sitekey `6c824b97-caeb-4a2a-9144-db4f1c9f86d0`).
> Across 3 converged autobrowse iterations (4 `started` / 175 `attempted` /
> **0 `solved`** solver events), the `browserless_agent` solve command engaged
> on every attempt but never cleared the challenge. The form-fill workflow below
> is fully mapped and verified working up to the submit step; passing the
> hCaptcha is the single unsolved blocker. See Site-Specific Gotchas.

## When to Use

- Look up a NY civil/criminal/family case by index or docket number.
- Find all cases for a party name (last + first or business) in a court/county.
- Find an attorney's cases within a filing-date range.
- Pull a case's caption, judge, attorneys, parties, NYSCEF id, and history.
- Any read-only NY court-docket lookup. Not for filing or paying.

## Workflow

There is **no public API, JSON endpoint, or URL-param deep-link** that returns
docket data — the eCourts surfaces are classic server-rendered ASP.NET/Java
WebForms, and every search submit is hCaptcha-gated (see Gotchas). The browser
flow below is the only path. Drive it with `browserless_agent` and a residential
proxy (`proxy: { proxy: "residential" }`) — mandatory, because bare sessions draw
Cloudflare `cdn-cgi/challenge-platform` interstitials immediately. Batch the
open→fill→submit sequence inside ONE call's `commands` array to save round-trips, and
repeat the same `proxy` arg on every call — the session is keyed by it, so a follow-up
call with the same `proxy` reconnects to the same warmed browser with its Cloudflare
cookies intact, while dropping or changing it lands in a different, blank session.

### 1. Pick the surface from the input shape

| Input                                          | Surface                     | Entry URL                                             |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Index number (`123456/2024`), Supreme civil    | WebCivil Supreme — Index    | `…/webcivil/FCASSearch?param=I`                       |
| Party / business name, Supreme civil           | WebCivil Supreme — Party    | `…/webcivil/FCASSearch?param=P`                       |
| Attorney name + filing dates, Supreme civil    | WebCivil Supreme — Attorney | `…/webcivil/FCASSearch?param=A`                       |
| Justice/judge name                             | WebCivil Supreme — Justice  | `…/webcivil/FCASSearch?param=J`                       |
| NYC Civil / Housing Part / Town & Village      | WebCivil Local              | `…/webcivilLocal/LCSearch?param={I\|P\|A}`            |
| Criminal docket (`CR-12345-24NY`), defendant   | WebCriminal                 | `…/webcrim_attorney/DefendantSearch`                  |
| Family                                         | WebFamily                   | `…/fcasfamily/…` (302-gated; often access-restricted) |
| A direct `iapps.courts.state.ny.us` detail URL | use as-is                   | open directly                                         |

Base host for all of the above: `https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us`.
The hub page `…/webcivil/ecourtsMain` links every surface.

### 2. Fill the search form (WebCivil Supreme — verified working)

All four WebCivil Supreme search types (`param=I/P/A/J`) and WebCivil Local
render the **same shared `FCASSearch` form** (`<form id="search_form"
method="post" action="FCASSearch">`); JS shows/hides fields per `hWhichPage`.
Field reference (verified):

- `#txtIndex` — index number (Index search).
- `#txtPlaintiffLname` — **the party-name box for ALL roles** (despite the
  "Plaintiff" id). Put the last name / business name here.
- `#txtAttorneyLname` — attorney/firm name (Attorney search).
- `#txtJudgeLname` — justice name (Justice search).
- `rdRepresents` radios — role: `Plaintiff` (= Plaintiff/Petitioner),
  `Defendant` (= Defendant/Respondent), `OtherRoles`, `AllRoles`.
- `#cboCourt` — county/court **multi-select** (Ctrl-click for multiple). Labels
  read like `"New York Supreme Court"`, `"Kings Supreme Court"`,
  `"Nassau Supreme Court"`, etc. — one option per county. **Required** for
  party/attorney searches.
- `#cboYearOfFiling` — year dropdown (Index/Attorney scoping).
- `rbStatus` radios — `open` (Active/Restored) or `all`.
- `rbFutureCases` radios — `Y`/`N` (return only cases with future appearances).
- `#cboSort` — sort order (`Year Filed/Index Number`, etc.).
- `rbOutputFormat` radios — `HTML` (keep this — it's scrapeable) or `PDF`.

Exact verified sequence (party search):

1. `{ "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "…/webcivil/FCASSearch?param=P", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } }`
2. `{ "method": "snapshot" }` once.
3. `{ "method": "type", "params": { "selector": "#txtPlaintiffLname", "text": "<name>" } }`.
4. `click` the desired `rdRepresents` role radio.
5. `click` the county option in `#cboCourt` from the snapshot. **The `select`
   command on `#cboCourt` fails** ("could not find element") — `click` the option
   ref instead.
6. `click` the `rbStatus` radio (`all` for both active + disposed).
7. Leave `rbOutputFormat` = HTML.
8. `click` `#btnFindCase` ("Find Case(s)").

### 3. Clear the hCaptcha (the blocker)

Clicking **Find Case(s)** posts to `FCASSearch` and lands on an hCaptcha
"Verify you are human / Terms of Use" interstitial. The submit button itself
carries the widget (`class="… h-captcha"`, `data-callback="onSubmit"`).

- Issue a `{ "method": "solve", "params": { "type": "hcaptcha" } }` to invoke the
  built-in solver.
- **Do not manually solve.** Clicking the checkbox more than once, opening the
  "Retrieve accessibility cookie" menu, or interacting with the image challenge
  cancels the auto-solver and traps you on a "drag the missing piece" puzzle.
- Best-known pattern: fire `solve` once, then poll passively (a
  `{ "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 15000 } }` + re-`snapshot`,
  up to ~90s) without touching anything. **In testing this still did not clear** —
  treat a >90s stall as the wall and emit `success: false, reason: "captcha_unsolved"`.

### 4. Extract results (post-captcha — design target)

Once past the captcha the results page is a paginated HTML table. Prefer a
`{ "method": "text", "params": { "selector": "body" } }` (or fold the parsing into
an `evaluate`) over per-row clicks. Per row:
index number, caption (parties), court/county, and the case-detail link
(`…/webcivil/FCASCaseInfo?…`). Open one detail page and extract court+county+
part, nature of action / case type, filing date, disposition date, status,
assigned judge, attorneys (name/firm/role/bar #), parties (name/role/rep),
most-recent + full appearance/motion history (detail tab), NYSCEF case id +
its document-list URL (`…/nyscef/…`), and the canonical detail URL.

### 5. Session teardown

No session-release step — there is nothing to release. The session persists across
calls, keyed by `proxy`; keeping the whole open→fill→submit→extract flow in one
call's `commands` array just saves round-trips and avoids accidentally dropping that
config. A failed submit can also be retried alone with the same `proxy`, against the
still-live page.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **hCaptcha gates every search submit — system-wide.** Sitekey
  `6c824b97-caeb-4a2a-9144-db4f1c9f86d0` is identical across WebCivil Supreme
  (`FCASSearch`), WebCivil Local (`LCSearch`), and WebCriminal
  (`DefendantSearch`). There is no captcha-free search surface. The `solve`
  command attempted it 175 times across 3 iterations and cleared it **0 times** —
  it is a hard/enterprise hCaptcha variant the solver cannot currently clear.
  Don't burn turns waiting >90s; report the wall.
- **Manual captcha interaction makes it worse.** Clicking the checkbox repeatedly
  or opening the accessibility-cookie menu cancels the in-flight auto-solver and
  drops you onto a visual "drag the missing piece" challenge that is even harder.
  At most one checkbox click, then hands off.
- **Residential proxy mandatory.** The whole `iapps.courts.state.ny.us`
  host sits behind Cloudflare (`cdn-cgi/challenge-platform`) plus per-path
  `__cf_bm`/`TS*` cookies. Bare sessions get challenged before the form even
  loads. Always pass `proxy: { proxy: "residential" }`.
- **`#txtPlaintiffLname` is the universal party-name field** for every role —
  the id is misleading. The `rdRepresents` radio, not the field, sets the role.
- **The `select` command on `#cboCourt` does not work** — the county multi-select
  must be driven by clicking the option ref from a snapshot.
- **Selecting a county is effectively required** for party/attorney searches;
  an unscoped statewide search is very slow and may time out.
- **Shared form across search types.** `param=I/P/A/J` all return the same
  `FCASSearch` form HTML; the active fields are toggled client-side by the
  hidden `hWhichPage` value. Set the right `param` in the URL so the correct
  fields are visible.
- **WebFamily / Housing Part are access-restricted.** `…/fcasfamily/fcasMain`
  302-redirects; many Family and Housing records are not public. When a surface
  returns an access-restriction notice, surface that message
  (`access_restricted: true`) rather than fabricating data.
- **Output format matters.** Choose HTML, not PDF — the HTML results table is
  scrapeable; PDF output returns a binary you'd have to parse.
- **No API / no deep-link.** Confirmed: there is no JSON endpoint and no
  query-param URL that returns docket data without going through the captcha-
  gated WebForm. Don't waste time hunting for one.
- **eFiling lives on a separate surface.** NYSCEF (`…/nyscef/…`) and Surrogate's
  Court (`websurrogates.nycourts.gov`) are distinct apps; case-detail pages link
  out to the NYSCEF document list when a matter is e-filed.
