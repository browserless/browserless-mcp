# Southwest Airlines Flight Search

## Purpose

Search southwest.com for available flights between two airports on given dates and return matching itineraries — flight numbers, routing, segments, durations, stop counts, connection airports, layovers, on-time-performance (when shown), and a four-bucket fares object (`wanna_get_away` / `wanna_get_away_plus` / `anytime` / `business_select`) priced in both USD and Rapid Rewards points + tax. Supports round-trip and one-way (multi-city is modeled as a sequence of one-ways — Southwest does not sell true multi-city), Dollars or Points fare mode, full passenger mix (adult / child / lap-infant / senior), promo code, time-of-day / stops / sort filters, and the Low Fare Calendar month-grid sweep. **Read-only — never click Continue, Select, Book, or any seat-selection control.** Southwest deliberately refuses syndication to third-party search engines (Kayak, Google Flights, Expedia), so southwest.com is the only source of truth for Southwest fares.

## When to Use

- Compare Southwest's four fare tiers for a specific O-D pair on specific dates.
- Sweep a month-grid for the cheapest-day fare (Low Fare Calendar).
- Price the same itinerary in dollars vs. Rapid Rewards points to inform a points-vs-cash decision.
- Confirm whether a Southwest route exists at all (Southwest's network is heavily point-to-point — many city pairs require connections, and some "expected" pairs like JFK don't exist because Southwest doesn't serve JFK).
- Any flow that needs Southwest fares — they cannot be obtained from any OTA, meta-search, or GDS aggregator.

## Workflow

The only reliable surface is the **scripted browser flow** (`browserless_agent`) with the `/air/booking/select.html?…` deep-link URL. The internal JSON endpoint `/api/air-booking/v1/air-booking/page/air/booking/shopping` (and all sibling `/api/air-booking/v1/*` and `/api/content/v1/*` routes) returns **Akamai 403 Access Denied** on every cookieless HTTP call — verified across direct out-of-band fetches and a residential-proxy fetch (Reference `#18.1071ca17`). Don't waste cycles trying to hit those endpoints; lead with the deep-link + scripted browsing path described below.

### 1. Residential-proxy session (mandatory)

Every `browserless_agent` call must carry a residential proxy — pass the top-level `proxy` arg on **every** call:

```json
{ "proxy": { "proxy": "residential", "proxyCountry": "us" } }
```

The residential proxy is non-negotiable. Southwest is fronted by Akamai Bot Manager (`bazadebezolkohpepadr` token, `/akam/13/8333552` sensor, `ak_bmsc` + `bm_mi` + `bm_sz` cookies). A datacenter or proxy-less session gets either the generic "There was a problem" error page or an outright Akamai-Access-Denied HTML.

A `browserless_agent` session **persists across separate calls** — it is keyed by the call's `proxy` config, so a later call carrying the **same** `proxy` reconnects to the same warmed browser with its Akamai cookies (`ak_bmsc`, `bm_sz`, …) intact; there is still no session-release step to make. For convenience, **keep the whole deep-link → hydrate → snapshot → extract flow inside ONE call's `commands` array** — it saves round-trips and avoids accidentally dropping the `proxy` config on a follow-up call. If you do split it across calls, **repeat the same `proxy` on every call**; a call that drops or changes it lands in a different, cookieless session that Akamai rejects.

### 2. Skip the form — go directly to the results page via deep-link URL

Southwest accepts the entire search payload as URL query parameters on `/air/booking/select.html`, which 301-redirects to `/air/booking/select-depart.html` and triggers the same React shopping flow the form would. **This saves ~6 turns of form filling, autocomplete waiting, and date-picker clicking per search.**

```
https://www.southwest.com/air/booking/select.html
    ?originationAirportCode=DAL
    &destinationAirportCode=LAS
    &departureDate=2026-06-15
    &returnDate=2026-06-18
    &tripType=roundtrip                  // or "oneway" (no &returnDate)
    &adultPassengersCount=1              // 1-8
    &seniorPassengersCount=0             // 65+; counts toward total (max 8)
    &passengerType=ADULT                 // primary passenger pricing class
    &fareType=USD                        // "USD" (dollars) or "POINTS"
    &promoCode=                          // optional, leave empty for none
    &int=HOMEQBOMAIR                     // internal tracking; safe to omit
```

Open it — put the `goto` and the hydration wait in the same `commands` array (see §4/§5 for the full single-call shape):

```json
{
  "proxy": { "proxy": "residential", "proxyCountry": "us" },
  "commands": [
    {
      "method": "goto",
      "params": {
        "url": "https://www.southwest.com/air/booking/select.html?originationAirportCode=DAL&destinationAirportCode=LAS&departureDate=2026-06-15&returnDate=2026-06-18&tripType=roundtrip&adultPassengersCount=1&fareType=USD&passengerType=ADULT",
        "waitUntil": "load",
        "timeout": 45000
      }
    },
    { "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 4000 } }
  ]
}
```

Use `waitUntil: "load"` (never `networkidle` — the SPA polls and never idles). The 4 s pause lets the fare grid hydrate asynchronously; §4 gives the more robust text-based wait signal.

URL-param contract (verified from 301-redirect echo behavior and bootstrap config):

### 3. Resolve airport codes (when input is a city name, not IATA)

The full Southwest airport list (122 stations, including Caribbean / Mexico / Central America) is published as a base64-encoded JS bundle at:

```
https://www.southwest.com/swa-ui/bootstrap/air-booking-v2/1/data.js
```

Fetch it with `browserless_function`. The bundle lives on the `www.southwest.com` origin, so a same-origin in-page `fetch` works once the page has navigated there — `page.goto('https://www.southwest.com/')` first (a bare `fetch` in the function runtime has no network egress until the page is on the origin), then `page.evaluate` the fetch, base64-decode, and **parse/project the airport records inside the eval** — return only the matched records, never the ~650 KB decoded blob (the function text return is capped). Grep the decoded text for `"emailDisplayName":"…","cityServed":"…","stationName":"…","id":"XYZ"` records:

```js
export default async function ({ page }) {
  await page.goto('https://www.southwest.com/', {
    waitUntil: 'load',
    timeout: 45000,
  });
  const records = await page.evaluate(async () => {
    const b64 = await fetch('/swa-ui/bootstrap/air-booking-v2/1/data.js').then(
      (r) => r.text(),
    );
    const src = atob(b64);
    const out = [];
    const re =
      /"emailDisplayName":"([^"]*)","cityServed":"([^"]*)","stationName":"([^"]*)","id":"([A-Z]{3})"/g;
    let m;
    while ((m = re.exec(src)))
      out.push({
        emailDisplayName: m[1],
        cityServed: m[2],
        stationName: m[3],
        id: m[4],
      });
    return out;
  });
  return { data: records, type: 'application/json' };
}
```

Run this behind the same residential proxy (pass `proxy` on the `browserless_function` call too). This is faster, cheaper, and more reliable than driving Southwest's airport autocomplete UI for the lookup. Cache the returned list — it is the full 122-station table.

Example records:

```
"emailDisplayName":"Dallas (Love)","cityServed":"Dallas","stationName":"Dallas (Love Field)","id":"DAL"
"emailDisplayName":"Chicago (Midway)","cityServed":"Chicago","stationName":"Chicago (Midway)","id":"MDW"
"emailDisplayName":"Chicago (O'Hare-Terminal 5)","cityServed":"Chicago","stationName":"Chicago (O'Hare-Terminal 5)","id":"ORD"
```

Multi-airport cities surface multiple records — use `cityServed` for "any Dallas airport" and pick `DAL` (Love) vs. `DFW` (Southwest does NOT serve DFW; only DAL).

### 4. Wait for the fare grid to hydrate

The HTML shell that comes back from `/air/booking/select-depart.html` is ~5 KB of `<div id="root">` + script tags — the fare cells are rendered client-side after the React app calls `/api/air-booking/v1/air-booking/page/air/booking/shopping` from within the page context (where Akamai accepts the session). The grid takes 2–5 s wall-time to render after `load` fires.

Wait signal: at least one outbound row contains the text **"Wanna Get Away"** in a button. Don't snapshot before that — early snapshots get a skeleton-loader DOM. Gate on the text with a `waitForFunction`, then take the a11y snapshot — all in the same `commands` array as the `goto` from §2:

```json
{
  "proxy": { "proxy": "residential", "proxyCountry": "us" },
  "commands": [
    {
      "method": "goto",
      "params": {
        "url": "https://www.southwest.com/air/booking/select.html?originationAirportCode=DAL&destinationAirportCode=LAS&departureDate=2026-06-15&returnDate=2026-06-18&tripType=roundtrip&adultPassengersCount=1&fareType=USD&passengerType=ADULT",
        "waitUntil": "load",
        "timeout": 45000
      }
    },
    {
      "method": "waitForFunction",
      "params": {
        "fn": "document.body.innerText.includes('Wanna Get Away')",
        "timeout": 15000
      }
    },
    { "method": "snapshot" }
  ]
}
```

For a large results grid prefer parsing in-page with an `evaluate` command (return a compact JSON projection of the cards) over a raw `snapshot`, which can exceed the result-size limit.

### 5. Extract per-flight data from the snapshot

Each outbound itinerary card on `/air/booking/select-depart.html` exposes:

- **Flight number(s)** — 4-digit Southwest numerics (e.g., `1234`, `2789`); a connecting itinerary shows multiple flight numbers joined by `/` (e.g., `1234 / 5678`).
- **Routing** — origin → connection(s) → destination IATAs, visible as "DAL → LAS" or "DAL → HOU → LAS".
- **Depart / Arrive times** — local times per segment, displayed as `6:00 AM` etc. Combine with the URL's `departureDate` to build local ISO datetimes.
- **Aircraft type** — when surfaced, appears as "Boeing 737-700", "Boeing 737-800", or "Boeing 737 MAX 8" in the segment detail row. Southwest operates an all-737 fleet.
- **Total duration** — formatted `Xh Ym`.
- **Stop count + connection airport(s)** — "Nonstop", "1 stop in HOU", "2 stops in HOU, MCO".
- **Layover duration** — shown per connection as `Xh Ym layover in <CITY>`.
- **On-time-performance %** — when shown (Southwest surfaces this inconsistently, mostly on mainline routes), labeled "On-time performance: 78%".
- **Four-bucket fares** — `Wanna Get Away` / `Wanna Get Away Plus` / `Anytime` / `Business Select`. In Points mode the cell shows points + `+ $5.60` cash for taxes/fees. **Sold-out buckets render as "Unavailable" or are missing entirely** — flag as `sold_out: true`.

Internal fare-class enum (from the bootstrap config — useful when parsing DOM attributes): `WANNA_GET_AWAY_FARE`, `WANNA_GET_AWAY_PLUS_FARE`, `ANYTIME_FARE`, `BUSINESS_SELECT_FARE`.

For round-trips, the page renders **outbound first**; after extraction, `click` the "Return" tab (read-only — selecting a tab is not a booking action) and take a second `snapshot`/`evaluate` to extract the return leg using the same shape. Append these as further entries in the **same** `commands` array so the warmed Akamai session carries through.

### 6. Form-fallback path (only when URL deep-link is insufficient)

The deep-link URL covers adults + seniors, dates, O-D, fare type, promo. It does **not** cover:

- Children (ages 2–11) — must be added on the in-page passenger drawer.
- Lap infants (< 2) — same.
- Multi-city sequences — drive two one-way searches in sequence.

When the search requires children or lap-infants, `goto` `https://www.southwest.com/air/booking/` (the form, not the deep-link) and drive the form as a sequence of commands in one `browserless_agent` call (confirm any label via a `snapshot` if a selector misses):

1. `click` `radio: Round Trip` or `radio: One Way`.
2. `click` `combobox: Depart` (the origin field), `type` the 3-letter IATA, `waitForTimeout` 1500 ms for the autocomplete dropdown, then `click` the matching `option: <City>, <ST> - <IATA>`.
3. Repeat for `combobox: Return`.
4. `click` the depart-date input → date picker → `click` the target date cell. Repeat for return date.
5. `click` `button: Passengers` → adjust adult / child / lap-infant counts via the +/- steppers → `click` `button: Confirm`. Senior toggles also live here.
6. `click` `button: Search` and continue from §4.

Do NOT drive the airport combobox with a single `type` that auto-submits — a `type` carrying a trailing Enter (or a `press Enter`) fires before the dropdown surfaces. Use a `click` on the field, then a `type` of the plain IATA, then a `waitForTimeout` 1500 ms, then `click` the option.

### 7. Low Fare Calendar (month-grid sweep)

The Low Fare Calendar shows the cheapest fare across a 30-day window. Deep-link:

```
https://www.southwest.com/air/low-fare-calendar/
    ?originationAirportCode=DAL
    &destinationAirportCode=LAS
    &tripType=roundtrip
    &adultPassengersCount=1
    &fareType=USD
    &passengerType=ADULT
```

(No `departureDate` / `returnDate` — the calendar picks its own anchor month.) Each day-cell renders the lowest available fare for an outbound departing that date (round-trip pricing assumes a 3-night return; one-way mode shows one-way price). Capture per-day cheapest fare and the matching day-cell `data-` attribute or aria-label. Calendar hydration is the same — wait for the first price cell to render before snapshotting.

`/air/low-fare-calendar.html` (note the `.html` suffix) returns 404 — only the trailing-slash form works.

### 8. Filters (results page only)

Once on `/air/booking/select-depart.html`, the results page exposes a filter drawer (`button: Filter`):

- **Stops** — Nonstop / 1 stop / 2+ stops.
- **Departure time window** — Early morning (12am–5am), Morning (5am–noon), Afternoon (noon–6pm), Evening (6pm–midnight).
- **Sort** — Departure / Arrival / Duration / Price (per fare bucket).

Apply via UI clicks; there are no URL-param forms of these filters that survive a 301 redirect. Re-snapshot after each filter click.

### 9. Session teardown

No session-release step — there is nothing to release. The session persists across calls, keyed by the `proxy` config: a later call with the same `proxy` reconnects to the same warmed browser with its Akamai cookies intact. As a convenience, keep the whole flow (warm-up → hydrate → extract → filter → return-tab) inside ONE call's `commands` array to save round-trips and avoid accidentally dropping the `proxy` config; if you split it, repeat the same `proxy` on every call so you stay in the same session.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **READ-ONLY.** Never click `button: Continue`, the per-fare-cell `button: Select`, or any seat-map control. Selecting a fare advances to a passenger-info page and starts a booking flow. Stop at the results / calendar grid.
- **Akamai is the protection layer.** Bot-manager fingerprint script at `/akam/13/8333552`, sensor token `bazadebezolkohpepadr`, edge cookies `ak_bmsc` + `bm_mi` + `bm_sz`. Verified Akamai routing via `Akamai-Request-Bc` response header. `a stealth + residential-proxy session` is non-negotiable.
- **The internal JSON shopping API is confirmed-blocked from cookieless callers.** `/api/air-booking/v1/air-booking/page/air/booking/shopping`, `/api/air-booking/v1/air-booking/page/air/booking/price`, `/api/air-booking/v1/air-booking/page/air/booking/purchase-secure`, `/api/air-booking/v1/air-booking/page/air/booking/confirmation-secure`, and `/api/content/v1/*` all return Akamai 403 (`Reference #18.1071ca17.…`) when called out-of-band even behind a residential proxy — a fresh residential-proxy IP and no other anti-bot diff didn't help. Don't try to replay them out-of-band; the page-context fetch the React app makes (from inside a warmed `browserless_agent` session) is the only way Akamai accepts them. **Don't waste time on direct API calls.**
- **`/v2/` path is `Disallow:` in `robots.txt`.** Southwest's robots.txt forbids spidering `/v2/*` (which is where the React static bundles live: `/v2/air/booking/static/9.0.1/...`). This is a politeness signal — the booking flow is on `/air/booking/*` which is allowed.
- **`select.html` → `select-depart.html` 301 redirect is part of the contract.** The form-submit endpoint is `/air/booking/select.html`; that URL 301s to `/air/booking/select-depart.html` carrying all query params unchanged. Build your deep-link against `select.html` and let the redirect resolve — both URLs work, but constructing against `select.html` matches what the form does.
- **`fareType` value mismatch.** The URL param value is `USD` (or `POINTS`); the page's internal state object uses `DOLLARS`/`POINTS`. Don't send `fareType=DOLLARS` in the URL — verified the form sends `USD`.
- **Children and lap-infants are NOT URL-deeplinkable.** Only `adultPassengersCount` and `seniorPassengersCount` are read from the URL; children and lap-infants must be added in the in-page passenger drawer. If you need them, take the form-fill path (§6).
- **Southwest does NOT serve DFW or JFK.** Common pre-flight check: confirm both origin and destination are in the 122-airport list at §3. Don't fabricate a route — the SPA renders "We couldn't find any flights" silently if the route doesn't exist.
- **All-737 fleet.** Aircraft type is always `Boeing 737-700`, `Boeing 737-800`, or `Boeing 737 MAX 8` when shown. Treat any other value as a parse error.
- **The fare grid hydrates 2–5 s after `load`.** Snapshot too early and you get the skeleton DOM with no price cells. Wait until at least one row contains "Wanna Get Away" text before extracting.
- **"There was a problem" generic error page.** When Akamai bot-detection trips mid-session or the hydration XHR fails, Southwest renders a generic error card. Capture the page text and retry once as a distinct `browserless_agent` session (residential proxy — because a call reusing the same config would reconnect to the same tripped session, start a fresh session, e.g. by not reusing the prior config, so it lands on a clean IP/fingerprint). If it recurs, return `success: false, reason: "site_error"` rather than re-attempting indefinitely.
- **Geolocation is Akamai-inferred from the proxy IP.** The HTML shell includes `swa.geolocation = "georegion=…,country_code=US,region_code=NY,…"`. This doesn't affect fare results but may cause US dollar/points denomination defaults. For non-US searches, no URL param is needed — Southwest only sells in USD/Rapid Rewards.
- **The bootstrap data bundle is base64-encoded.** `https://www.southwest.com/swa-ui/bootstrap/air-booking-v2/1/data.js` returns a base64 string that decodes to a ~650 KB JS module containing the airport list, fare-class enums, family-trip destination lists, and other UI metadata. The accompanying `…/content/en.js` is similarly base64-encoded but contains CMS strings (homepage copy), not fare/airport data — only `data.js` is useful for the airport-resolution shortcut in §3.
- **Sold-out buckets ≠ missing fare class.** A flight that shows three of four prices with the fourth replaced by "Unavailable" is sold out on that bucket. A flight that shows fewer than four buckets total may be on a fare-class-restricted route (e.g., some short-haul routes don't sell Business Select). Distinguish in output: `sold_out: true` vs `not_offered: true`.
- **Senior fares (`seniorPassengersCount`) are a separate pricing class** but render in the same four-bucket grid; you can verify by re-running the same itinerary with `seniorPassengersCount=1` and confirming a different price (typically only Anytime and Wanna Get Away change).
- **No-change-fees + two-free-bags are static perks.** Surface them as static metadata in the response (`perks: ["Two free checked bags", "No change fees"]`), not as a per-flight field — they apply to all Southwest itineraries equally and the bootstrap config confirms `fareTypes.WGA.features.NO_CHANGE_FEE = true` for every fare bucket.
- **The Low Fare Calendar URL is `/air/low-fare-calendar/` (trailing slash, no `.html`).** `/air/low-fare-calendar.html` returns 404. Easy footgun.
- **Filter state is not URL-encoded.** Stops, time-of-day, and sort filters live in client-side React state only — they do not survive a page reload. Apply filters via UI clicks after the results render; don't try to URL-encode them.
