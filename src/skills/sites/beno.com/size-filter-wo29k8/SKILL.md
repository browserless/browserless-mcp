# Beno Yacht Size Filter (Min & Max Length)

## Purpose

Filter Beno's Dubai/UAE yacht-rental listing by **yacht size** — a minimum and maximum length in **feet** — and read back the yachts that fall inside that range. Beno is a luxury rental marketplace (yachts, cars, helicopters, etc.); "size" on the yacht listing means hull length in feet, exposed as a dual-handle range slider (default 20–200 ft). This skill is **read-only**: it sets the filter and extracts the resulting yacht cards (name, length, guest capacity, hourly price). It never books.

## When to Use

- "Show me yachts between 60 and 120 feet on Beno."
- A shopping agent narrowing yacht options to a size band before comparing prices.
- Any flow that needs the set of Beno yachts whose length is within a `[min, max]` foot range, with their guest capacity and hourly rate.
- NOT for cars/helicopters/buggies — those listings have their own filters; "size" as length-in-feet is a yacht concept.

## Workflow

The recommended method is the **browser UI**, driving the filter modal on `https://www.beno.com/yachts`. The listing is a JavaScript (Angular) SPA whose data comes from a private API (`apps-api.beno.com/v3/deals/products/yacht`), but that endpoint is CloudFront/WAF-protected and returns `403 Forbidden` to direct and page-context fetches — it is **not** a usable fast-path (see Gotchas). The clean URL `?/yachts?sizes=<min>,<max>` _is_ a real deep-link, but it is unreliable on a cold page load (cards frequently stick on "Loading…"), so prefer applying the filter through the modal on an already-loaded listing.

Run the whole warm-up → open-modal → set-sliders → apply → extract sequence inside **one** `browserless_agent` call's `commands` array (batching keeps the DOM/state alive across the steps). The site is UAE-geo, so use a top-level `proxy: { proxy: "residential", proxyCountry: "ae" }`.

1. **Open the listing page (warm it up first).**

   ```json
   { "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "https://www.beno.com/yachts", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } },
   { "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 5000 } }
   ```

   Use `/yachts` — **not** `/yachts/yachts`, which returns a 500 error page. The `waitUntil: "load"` plus the timeout lets the `Loading…` placeholders get replaced by real cards (each card reads "`<n> Guests · <n> Cabins · <n> Length · <rating>`"). This takes ~5–8 s.

2. **Open the Filter modal.** Locate the button labelled `icon Filters` (it gains a count badge, e.g. `icon Filters 1`, once a filter is active) via a `{ "method": "snapshot" }` and click it.

   ```json
   { "method": "snapshot" },
   { "method": "click", "params": { "selector": "..." } },
   { "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 2000 } }
   ```

   The modal contains, top-to-bottom: **Sort By**, **Harbors**, **Brands**, and **Size**, with **Reset** / **Apply** at the bottom.

3. **Set the Size min and max via JavaScript (most reliable).** The Size control is two native `<input type="range">` elements (`min=20`, `max=200`, `step=1`): the **first** input is the MIN handle, the **second** is the MAX handle. Setting them with the native value setter + `input`/`change` events updates the Angular model and the "Min. N Feet / Max. N Feet" labels:

   ```json
   {
     "method": "evaluate",
     "params": {
       "content": "(() => { const s=[...document.querySelectorAll('input[type=range]')]; const setN=(el,v)=>{const p=Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(HTMLInputElement.prototype,'value').set; p.call(el,String(v)); el.dispatchEvent(new Event('input',{bubbles:true})); el.dispatchEvent(new Event('change',{bubbles:true}));}; setN(s[0], 60); setN(s[1], 120); return JSON.stringify(s.map(x=>x.value)); })()"
     }
   }
   ```

   `s[0]` is the MIN handle (60 feet), `s[1]` is the MAX handle (120 feet); the result comes back under `.value`. Do **not** waste turns trying to scroll the modal's accessibility tree to drag the handles — the modal a11y snapshot is large and partly truncated, and dragging is imprecise. The JS setter is deterministic. (Focusing a handle and pressing Arrow keys also works but costs one keypress per foot.)

4. **Apply.** Locate and click the `button: Apply` (confirm the selector via `snapshot` if the click misses).

   ```json
   { "method": "snapshot" },
   { "method": "click", "params": { "selector": "..." } },
   { "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 4000 } }
   ```

   On success the URL becomes `https://www.beno.com/yachts?sizes=60,120` and the Filters button shows a `1` badge.

5. **Extract the results.** Each yacht card exposes its length as "`<n> Length`" text. Pull names, lengths, guest counts and hourly prices and confirm every length is within `[min, max]`:

   ```json
   {
     "method": "evaluate",
     "params": {
       "content": "(() => { const t=document.body.innerText; const lengths=[...t.matchAll(/(\\d+)\\s*Length/g)].map(m=>+m[1]); return JSON.stringify({loading:/Loading/.test(t), count:(t.match(/Guests/g)||[]).length, lengths, allWithinRange: lengths.every(l=>l>=60 && l<=120)}); })()"
     }
   }
   ```

   The projection returns under `.value`. If `loading` is still `true` after the wait, the listing API failed for this session/IP — see the loading-hang gotcha. Re-run the whole flow with a fresh `browserless_agent` call (new proxy IP).

6. **No session-release step.** The `browserless_agent` session persists across calls (keyed by `proxy`/`profile`) — there is nothing to release, and keeping steps 1–5 in one call saves round-trips and avoids accidentally dropping that session config.

### Browser fallback / shortcut: the `?sizes=` deep-link

`https://www.beno.com/yachts?sizes=<min>,<max>` (comma-separated, no spaces) is the canonical URL the modal produces, and it does pre-activate the size filter (Filters badge shows `1`). It is handy for re-applying a known range _within an already-loaded SPA session_, but on a **cold** load it frequently hangs with the cards stuck on "Loading…". If you use it, always verify cards actually rendered (step 5) and fall back to the warm modal flow (steps 1–4) if they did not.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **Use `/yachts`, never `/yachts/yachts`.** The `/yachts/yachts` path (which appears in search-engine results) returns a "500 — Something's gone wrong" page. The working listing URL is `https://www.beno.com/yachts`.
- **"Size" = yacht length in feet.** Default slider range is **20–200 ft**, `step=1`. Two native `<input type="range">`: index `0` = MIN, index `1` = MAX. Display labels are "Min. N Feet" / "Max. N Feet".
- **URL param is `sizes=<min>,<max>`** (e.g. `?sizes=60,120`). The underlying API form is `sizes[]=<min>,<max>` (URL-encoded `sizes%5B%5D=60%2C120`).
- **Listing cards lazy-load — budget 5–8 s.** Before cards render, the grid shows ten "Loading…" placeholders. Snapshotting/extracting too early returns zero yachts. Wait for "Guests"/"Length" text to appear.
- **The cold `?sizes=` deep-link is unreliable.** Navigating fresh to `https://www.beno.com/yachts?sizes=…` (and even reloading it) frequently leaves the cards stuck on "Loading…" indefinitely. Reproduced both manually and by the autobrowse inner agent (it burned its whole turn budget on this). The warm-then-apply modal flow is the dependable path.
- **The private listing API is a confirmed dead end — don't bother.** The cards are populated from `GET https://apps-api.beno.com/v3/deals/products/yacht?…&sizes%5B%5D=<min>,<max>&…`. A plain fetch / `browserless_agent` request still returns `403 {"message":"Forbidden"}` (CloudFront `ForbiddenException`), and a page-context `fetch()` fails with "Failed to fetch" (CORS). It needs app-injected auth/headers and is WAF-locked — there is no usable raw-API fast-path. Use the browser UI.
- **Loading hang ↔ API 403 is likely proxy-IP dependent.** The same WAF that 403s the API also appears to gate the in-app listing fetch on some egress IPs, which is what produces the persistent "Loading…" state. If results never load, re-run with a fresh `browserless_agent` call (new IP) rather than waiting longer.
- **Set sliders with JS, not drag/scroll.** The filter modal's accessibility snapshot is large and the Size section is below the modal's internal scroll; agents that try to scroll-and-drag waste many turns. Setting the two range inputs via the native value setter + `input`/`change` events is one deterministic call.
- **No homepage anti-bot.** The pre-run probe and observation show no Akamai/captcha/login wall on `beno.com` itself; the only blocking is the WAF on the `apps-api` data endpoint. Despite that, the successful run used a residential proxy egressing in the UAE (`proxy: { proxy: "residential", proxyCountry: "ae" }`, site is UAE-geo); a proxy-less session was not validated.
- **Currency/region.** Prices are shown in AED per hour by default (top-right `EN/AED` toggle). Many yachts also carry a discount badge ("35% off") and a struck-through original price.
- **Other filters share the modal.** The same modal also offers Sort By (Hourly Price Low→High / High→Low, Beno Evaluation), Harbors (Dubai Harbor, Dubai Islands Marina, Dubai Marina, Marsa Al Arab Marina, Marasi Marina Business Bay), and Brands. Setting Size does not disturb them; "Reset" clears all filters.
