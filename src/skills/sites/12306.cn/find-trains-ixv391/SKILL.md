# China Railway 12306 — Find Trains

## Purpose

Return the list of trains running between two stations on a given date
on China Railway's official site (12306.cn) — train number, departure /
arrival station and time, journey duration, and per-class seat
availability. Schedule data only; ticket prices and booking require an
authenticated session and are out of scope. Read-only.

## When to Use

- "What trains run from Beijing to Shanghai on 2026-05-26?"
- Mainland China rail itinerary planning (Beijing/Shanghai/Guangzhou/
  Chengdu / any HSR or conventional rail city).
- Comparing G (high-speed) vs D (动车 EMU) vs Z/T/K (conventional) train
  options for a corridor.
- Any flow that needs schedule + seat-class availability without
  booking. Booking, real-time seat counts past 0/1, and ticket prices
  need a logged-in flow and a different skill.

## Workflow

12306 ships a public JSON endpoint at `kyfw.12306.cn/otn/leftTicket/queryO`
that returns the full schedule for any origin/destination/date — same
data the official web UI renders, no login, no captcha, no rate-limit
in normal use. **The English site `www.12306.cn/en/` is a marketing /
FAQ landing page only; its "Search" button does nothing useful for
querying schedules.** The Chinese-language `kyfw.12306.cn` is the only
surface that returns real data.

The complication: `kyfw.12306.cn` is not resolvable from a typical
non-China egress (DNS or TCP block depending on path). Browserbase's
remote browser pool routes through endpoints that do resolve it — so
the cheapest reliable path is:

1. **Use `browserless_agent` with a residential proxy.**
   Pass `proxy: { proxy: "residential" }` as a top-level arg on the call.
   The proxy is **required** — without it `kyfw.12306.cn` often does not
   resolve from a non-China egress. The proxy also gives the session a
   real residential IP so the `nc.js` Alibaba anti-bot probe on
   `g.alicdn.com` stays quiet (this gives you a stealthed,
   residential-proxied session). Steps 3–4 below run as the ordered
   `commands` of **one** `browserless_agent` call so they share the same
   proxied session and its `/otn/...` cookies; if you split across
   multiple calls, repeat `proxy` on every one:

   ```jsonc
   {
     "rationale": "Querying 12306 train schedule",
     "proxy": { "proxy": "residential" },
     "commands": [/* goto init → waitForTimeout → evaluate, see steps 3–4 */],
   }
   ```

   If a slider captcha ever appears (over-synthetic session), the
   `browserless_agent` `solve` command can attempt it before you retry
   with a fresh call.

2. **Resolve from / to station to 12306 telecodes.** The station-code
   dictionary is served as a JS literal at
   `https://www.12306.cn/en/js/core/framework/station_name.js`
   (~115 KB, no proxy needed — `www.12306.cn` resolves anywhere). The
   payload is one big string:

   ```
   var station_names = '@bjb|北京北|VAP|beijingbei|bjb|0@bjd|北京东|BOP|beijingdong|bjd|1@bji|北京|BJP|beijing|bj|2@bjn|北京南|VNP|beijingnan|bjn|3...';
   ```

   Per record: `pinyin_abbr|chinese_name|telecode|full_pinyin|short_pinyin|sort_idx`.
   Use the 3-letter `telecode` (BJP, VNP, AOH, SHH, ...) — that's what
   the query API consumes. Pin city-level codes (BJP=北京, SHH=上海) when
   the user gives a city name; pin specific-station codes (VNP=北京南,
   AOH=上海虹桥) when they specify the station. City-level codes return
   trains from **every** station in that city (verified: BJP→SHH and
   VNP→AOH return the same 54-train set for Beijing→Shanghai on
   2026-05-26 — the API treats top-N station codes as a city alias).

3. **Establish session cookies by opening any kyfw page.** The query
   endpoint needs the `JSESSIONID`, `BIGipServerotn`, and `route`
   cookies that any first `/otn/...` page sets. First two commands of
   the call — open the init page and let the anti-bot
   `g.alicdn.com/sd/ncpc/nc.js` probe settle:

   ```jsonc
   { "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "https://kyfw.12306.cn/otn/leftTicket/init", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } },
   { "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 4000 } }
   ```

4. **Call the schedule API from the page context** — the third command,
   an `evaluate`. Running the fetch in the page context auto-attaches
   the `/otn/...` cookies and a same-origin `Referer`; no UI interaction
   needed. Return a JSON string (`evaluate` gives it back under `.value`):

   ```jsonc
   {
     "method": "evaluate",
     "params": {
       "content": "(async()=>{const r=await fetch('https://kyfw.12306.cn/otn/leftTicket/queryO?leftTicketDTO.train_date=2026-05-26&leftTicketDTO.from_station=VNP&leftTicketDTO.to_station=AOH&purpose_codes=ADULT',{headers:{'X-Requested-With':'XMLHttpRequest'}});return JSON.stringify(await r.json());})()",
     },
   }
   ```

   The endpoint set is `queryO` (all train types — preferred default),
   `queryG` (high-speed only — G/D/C trains), `queryA` and `queryE`
   (legacy aliases, behave identically to `queryO` as of 2026-05). The
   page-context fetch automatically attaches the right cookies and a
   same-origin `Referer`.

5. **Parse the response.** Top-level shape:

   ```json
   {
     "httpstatus": 200,
     "data": {
       "result": ["<train1-pipe-string>", "<train2-pipe-string>", ...],
       "map": { "VNP": "北京南", "AOH": "上海虹桥", "SHH": "上海", ... },
       "flag": "1", "level": "...", "sametlc": "..."
     }
   }
   ```

   Each entry in `data.result[]` is a single `|`-separated positional
   string of ~50 fields. Reference field positions (0-indexed, after
   `split('|')`):

   | Seat-count values: an integer (exact remaining count when the         |
   | railway publishes it — typically only 0–20 are exposed precisely),    |
   | `有` (available, exact count not disclosed), `无` (sold out), or `""` |
   | (class not offered on this train). The `seat_types` enum chars at     |
   | index 45 map to: `9`=商务座, `P`=特等座, `M`=一等座, `O`=二等座,      |
   | `6`=高级软卧, `4`=软卧, `F`=动卧, `3`=硬卧, `2`=软座, `1`=硬座,       |
   | `W`=无座, `D`=其他/动卧 variants. Use `seat_types` to know which      |
   | classes a given train _can_ offer; cross-check against the            |
   | per-class fields to know which are sold out / sold-out / available.   |

   **Map `from_station_telecode` and `to_station_telecode` to display
   names via `data.map`** — that response sub-object is keyed by
   telecode and only contains the stations actually referenced in
   the result set (typically 5–10 entries, not the full dictionary).
   If a telecode in the result is not in `data.map` (rare; small or
   freight stations), fall back to the global `station_name.js`
   dictionary.

6. **Optional filters.** The API returns the full schedule
   unconditionally — there are no server-side filter params for train
   class, departure time, or seat class. Filter client-side:
   - High-speed only → keep rows where `station_train_code` starts with
     `G`, `D`, or `C`. (Equivalent to calling `queryG` instead of
     `queryO`.)
   - Available only → drop rows where every seat field in 32..41 is
     `无` or `""` (and `button_text` is not `预订`).

7. **No session release step.** There is nothing to release — but not
   because the session dies on return. A `browserless_agent` session
   persists across separate calls, keyed by the `proxy` config: a later
   call carrying the same `proxy` reconnects to the same warmed browser
   with its `/otn/...` cookies intact. To run another query, issue a new
   call with `proxy` set again; if you drop or change `proxy` you land in
   a different, blank session (which re-establishes the `/otn/...`
   cookies on its own init `goto`).

   The station-code dictionary (step 2, `station_name.js` on
   `www.12306.cn`, which resolves anywhere) is cheapest to fetch inside
   the same proxied `browserless_agent` call as an extra `evaluate`
   step, or from a `browserless_function` — but note that function
   sandbox runs in a **browser page context** (no Node, a bare `fetch`
   has no egress), so `page.goto('https://www.12306.cn/')` first, then
   `page.evaluate(() => fetch('/.../station_name.js').then(r=>r.text()))`.
   Cache the parsed dictionary; it changes rarely.

### Browser fallback

When the JSON API is unavailable (Alibaba probe fails / session denied
mid-query), the same data is fetched into the page's results table at
`https://kyfw.12306.cn/otn/leftTicket/init`. In a single `browserless_agent`
call (keep `proxy` set), seed the four cookies via `evaluate`, then
navigate and click the search button:

```jsonc
{ "method": "evaluate", "params": { "content":
  "(()=>{document.cookie='_jc_save_fromStation='+encodeURIComponent('北京')+'%2CBJP; path=/';document.cookie='_jc_save_toStation='+encodeURIComponent('上海')+'%2CSHH; path=/';document.cookie='_jc_save_fromDate=2026-05-26; path=/';document.cookie='_jc_save_wfdc_flag=dc; path=/';return 'ok';})()" } },
{ "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "https://kyfw.12306.cn/otn/leftTicket/init?linktypeid=dc", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } },
{ "method": "click", "params": { "selector": "#query_ticket" } },
{ "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 3000 } },
{ "method": "html", "params": { "selector": "#queryLeftTable" } }
```

(`查询` is `#query_ticket`, class `.btn92s`; the results table is
`#queryLeftTable`.) The same `queryO` XHR fires from the JS bundle and
populates the table; parse the returned HTML rows. This costs ~5× more
than the direct API path because the table renders progressively and
per-row seat cells use font-icon spans — prefer step 4's page-context
fetch. Note `evaluate`-set cookies and the subsequent `goto` must be in
the **same call** (same session) or the cookies won't be present.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **`kyfw.12306.cn` is geo-IP / DNS restricted from most non-China
  egress.** A plain `curl` from a non-China network fails with
  `Could not resolve host: kyfw.12306.cn`. The `browserless_agent`
  residential proxy (`proxy:{proxy:"residential"}`) routes through an
  endpoint that resolves it — that arg is **mandatory** for any query.
  If it still won't resolve, pin a China-adjacent `proxyCountry`. The
  marketing host `www.12306.cn` (used for `station_name.js` and the
  English info pages) is reachable everywhere.
- **English-language site is a decoy for schedule queries.**
  `https://www.12306.cn/en/index.html` has a `From / To / Date /
Search` form but its Search button is not wired to the production
  query API — it dead-ends. Do not waste turns trying to drive the
  English UI; use the Chinese `kyfw.12306.cn` JSON API.
- **City-code = top-N-station alias.** Passing the city-level telecode
  (`BJP` for Beijing, `SHH` for Shanghai, `CDU` for Chengdu, ...)
  returns the same result set as passing the city's primary HSR
  station (`VNP`, `AOH`, `IPH`, ...). It does **not** restrict to
  trains terminating at the small "main" station. Verified
  2026-05-19: `BJP→SHH`, `BJP→AOH`, and `VNP→AOH` all returned the
  identical 54-train set for 2026-05-26. To filter to a specific
  station, post-filter the result on `from_station_telecode` /
  `to_station_telecode` (indices 6 and 7).
- **`queryG` vs `queryO` vs `queryA` / `queryE`.** All four endpoints
  exist and return the same JSON shape. `queryG` is what the official
  UI calls when "High-speed only" is checked — but it actually returns
  the same rows as `queryO` (it filters client-side in the JS bundle;
  the API response is identical). Default to `queryO`. The endpoint
  name appears to flip occasionally during 12306 schedule-version
  rollovers — if one 404s or 302s to `mormhweb/logFiles/error.html`,
  try the next one in `[queryO, queryG, queryA, queryE]`.
- **`/mormhweb/logFiles/error.html` 302 = session missing.**
  Calling `queryO` without first hitting any `/otn/...` page in the
  same browser session returns `302 → error.html` because the
  load-balancer cookies (`BIGipServerotn`, `JSESSIONID`, `route`) are
  not set. Always open `https://kyfw.12306.cn/otn/leftTicket/init`
  (or any `/otn/` path) once per session before calling the API.
- **`g.alicdn.com/sd/ncpc/nc.js` runs on every page load.** This is
  Alibaba's anti-bot probe (the same `nc.js` that backs Taobao's
  slider captcha). It does not gate the schedule API in our trace —
  but it does run, takes ~2 s, and can stall the page-context fetch
  if the session is too obviously synthetic. The residential proxy +
  real Chrome of a `browserless_agent` session keeps the probe quiet;
  a bare/un-proxied session can see the slider captcha within ~5 page
  loads — if it appears, try the `solve` command, then fall back to a
  fresh call.
- **Prices are not in the public response.** Field 12 (`yp_info`) is a
  URL-encoded base64 blob; decryption requires the per-session AES key
  that 12306 ships only after login. The unauthenticated
  `/otn/leftTicketPrice/queryAllPublicPrice?...` endpoint returns
  200 OK with `data: []` (verified 2026-05-19) — confirmed dead end.
  Document price as `null` in the schema and tell users to check the
  app for fares. Booking is a strictly authenticated, captcha-gated
  flow that this read-only skill does **not** attempt.
- **Seat-count semantics are deliberately fuzzy.** The Railway
  publishes exact remaining seats only when the count is low (commonly
  0–20). Above that threshold the field is `有` ("available, count
  redacted") regardless of whether 30 or 800 seats remain. `无` =
  truly sold out. Empty string = the train does not offer that class.
  Do not paper over this — surface `available_count` as `int | "有" |
"无" | null` in the JSON output, not as a coerced integer.
- **Date precision: depart date only.** The query has no time-window
  filter. Trains crossing midnight are included; `arrive_time`'s clock
  rolls past `start_time` and `lishi` (duration) is the source of
  truth for overnight detection.
- **Booking-window cutoff.** China Railway opens 15-day forward
  booking. Queries for dates beyond `today + 15 days` return
  `data.result: []` with a `messages` warning string. Within the
  window, even unscheduled days (very early-morning queries on the
  day-of-opening) can briefly return empty before the daily seat
  release at 5:00 AM China time.
- **Station-code dictionary versions.** The path
  `/en/js/core/framework/station_name.js` is stable; the
  Chinese-language path includes a `_v<N>` suffix
  (`/index/script/core/common/station_name_v10198.js`) that
  rev-locks and 302s to `error.html` on a stale version. Always use
  the un-versioned English-side URL.
- **Don't bother with `snapshot` for the results table.** The
  `<table>` populates from JS after the XHR, with per-class seat
  status rendered as styled `<td>` text — but the accessibility-tree
  snapshot returns ~280–400 refs and the table cells aren't reliably
  enumerated as a list. Read the JSON directly (step 4); only fall back
  to `html`-scraping `#queryLeftTable` if the API path itself is
  blocked (we did not observe a block in 2 iters of testing).

Three distinct outcome shapes:

  "trains": [],
  "error_reasoning": "queryO 302→/mormhweb/logFiles/error.html — session cookies missing or kyfw.12306.cn unreachable (proxy required)"
}
```

Note: per-class `price_cny` is always `null` for unauthenticated
queries — the encrypted `yp_info` blob (field 12) requires a logged-in
AES key to decrypt. Surface `null` honestly; do not guess.
