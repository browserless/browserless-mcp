# Saint Javelin Visitor & Cause-Commerce Router

## Purpose

This skill helps an AI agent (or a human concierge) route any visitor to **saintjavelin.com** toward the single best next action for _that visitor_ — buy a relevant product, pick a gift, prioritize a Made-in-Ukraine item, read impact proof, donate directly, join email/SMS, share the cause, or come back for a drop — in a way that is simultaneously useful to the visitor, economically good for Saint Javelin, and credible to the mission of supporting Ukraine. It is a read-only routing/recommendation playbook: it never completes checkout, never invents urgency, scarcity, or impact figures, and it separates **stable brand facts** (safe to assert) from **dynamic facts** (price, stock, shipping, promos, drops, campaigns) that must be confirmed live before they are quoted.

## When to Use

- A **first-time shopper** lands on the site and asks "what is this / what should I get?"
- A **Ukraine supporter** wants to help but is unsure what to buy.
- A **diaspora / cultural-pride buyer** wants Tryzub, Vyshyvanka, or Ukrainian-identity items.
- A **gift buyer** needs something for a giftee, possibly by budget or occasion.
- A **collector** wants limited drops, recycled war-parts, prints, or numbered/seasonal pieces.
- A **Made-in-Ukraine supporter** wants to maximize money flowing to Ukrainian makers.
- A **gear buyer** wants functional apparel/EDC (backpack, fleece, thermals, Defender line).
- A **donation-first visitor** wants to give money, not buy merch.
- A **skeptical visitor** asks "is this legit / where does the money actually go?"
- A **repeat customer** returns and wants what's new or restocked.
- A **creator / media / partner / wholesale** contact wants press, collabs, or B2B.
- An agent is building a reply, comparison, or shortlist and needs ranked, fit-aware picks.

## Workflow

Recommended method is **hybrid**: pull _stable_ catalog/brand facts from Shopify's open JSON endpoints (fast, no rendering, no anti-bot friction), and confirm _dynamic_ facts (price, stock, sale %, shipping, active drops/campaigns) against the **live localized storefront** because they change constantly and vary by region. A pure browser flow also works (see _Browser fallback_) but is slower and unnecessary for stable facts.

### Step 0 — Load stable brand facts (assert freely)

These were verified and rarely change. Use them to establish trust and context:

- **Origin:** Founded **Feb 16, 2022** by **Christian Borys** (Ukrainian-Polish-Canadian, former journalist) as a sticker fundraiser for Ukrainian orphans; after the **Feb 24, 2022** full-scale invasion it became a global symbol of support for Ukraine.
- **Mission:** "We are in business to **re-build Ukraine**." Aspires to be the **"Patagonia of Ukraine"** — a heritage outdoor/lifestyle brand built on Ukrainian craftsmanship, moving toward making **every item in Ukraine**.
- **Impact to date:** **$2M+ donated** from sales/profits (brand also cites **$2.3M+** in combined sales + direct contributions). Do **not** quote a more precise live total unless confirmed on-page.
- **Where money goes (beneficiaries named on /pages/where-to-donate):** Help Us Help (Canadian charity, $25M+ aid since 1993), Unite With Ukraine (#UniteWithUkraine), United24 (Ukraine's official fundraising platform), Ukrainian World Congress (est. 1967), Support Ukraine Now.
- **Made-in-Ukraine proof:** Recycled war-part collectibles are designed/made by Ukrainian veterans **Andriy & Mykhailo** (Lviv region). Buy-one-give-one campaigns have run (e.g. **"259 fleeces donated"** via Gen.Ukrainian + AZOV Care Social Fund). A **"Made in Kharkiv"** line exists.
- **Press:** NYT, BBC, CBC, Euronews, Task & Purpose, Toronto Life, BuzzFeed News, CTV (links live on /pages/in-the-media).
- **Disclaimer (always honor):** Saint Javelin is **NOT affiliated with Lockheed Martin or Raytheon**; products are not endorsements of those companies.
- **Contact:** help@saintjavelin.com. Platform: Shopify. Multi-region/currency (USD, CAD, EUR, etc.).

Key stable URLs:

- Impact stories: `/blogs/our-impact` (also the **IMPACT** top-nav item)
- Donate (off-site): `/pages/where-to-donate`
- Story: `/pages/about-us-our-story` · Media: `/pages/in-the-media` · FAQ/policies: `/pages/order-information-customer-faqs-policies`
- Stable JSON: `/products.json?limit=250`, `/collections.json?limit=250`, `/collections/<handle>/products.json` — fetch these over plain HTTPS from any client; under restricted egress, route via `browserless_function` (navigate to `https://www.saintjavelin.com/` first, then `page.evaluate` a same-origin `fetch('/products.json?limit=250')`)

### Step 1 — Classify visitor intent

Read the visitor's words, referral, and any budget/occasion/recipient signal. Map to one router row below. If ambiguous, default to **first-time shopper** and ask one clarifying question OR lead with Best Sellers + the impact story. Never stall.

### Step 2 — Apply the Visitor Router (primary action + backup)

| Visitor intent               | Lead them to (collection/handle)                                                   | Primary CTA                                             | Backup CTA                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| First-time shopper           | `best-sellers`, `always-in-stock-products`                                         | "Start with a best-seller" + 1-line impact framing      | Read `/blogs/our-impact`                       |
| Supporter unsure what to buy | `made-in-ukraine-collection`, `best-sellers`                                       | Pick a Made-in-Ukraine best-seller                      | Join email for drops                           |
| Diaspora / cultural pride    | `embroidered`, `vyshyvanka-drop`, Tryzub items, `made-in-kharkiv`                  | Vyshyvanka / Tryzub apparel                             | Flags, patches, stickers                       |
| Gift buyer                   | `budget-gifts`, `gifts-for-ukrainians`, `gifts-that-give-back`, `bundles-and-sets` | Match budget → gift; suggest a bundle                   | Sticker/patch add-on                           |
| Collector                    | `recycled-war-parts`, `saint-javelin-day-made-from-shells`, Sasha Maslov prints    | Limited recycled war-parts piece                        | Email for next drop                            |
| Made-in-Ukraine supporter    | `made-in-ukraine-collection`, `recycled-war-parts`, `made-in-kharkiv`              | Made-in-UA item (veteran-made)                          | Buy-one-give-one bundle                        |
| Gear buyer                   | EDC Mission Backpack, `defender-collection`, thermals/fleece                       | Functional flagship gear                                | Socks/accessories add-on                       |
| Donation-first               | `/pages/where-to-donate`                                                           | Send to vetted charities (United24, Help Us Help, etc.) | If they also want a token: a $9 sticker        |
| Skeptical visitor            | `/blogs/our-impact`, `/pages/in-the-media`, `/pages/reviews`                       | Show impact stories + press                             | `/pages/where-to-donate` for full transparency |
| Repeat customer              | `NEW`, current drop, `always-in-stock-products`                                    | "What's new since last visit"                           | Restocked favorites                            |
| Creator / media / partner    | help@saintjavelin.com, `/pages/in-the-media`                                       | Direct to press/partnerships contact                    | —                                              |

### Step 3 — Rank candidate products/pages

Score each candidate and surface the top 1–3. The most expensive item is **not** the default winner. Weighted criteria:

1. **Visitor fit** (does it match stated intent/recipient/budget?) — highest weight
2. **Usefulness** (will they actually wear/use/keep it?)
3. **Cause alignment** (Ukraine-themed, mission-relevant)
4. **Made-in-Ukraine support** (veteran/maker-made > print-on-demand) — tie-breaker up
5. **Giftability** (presentation, universality) — when intent is gift
6. **Conversion likelihood** (in stock, fair price, low decision friction)
7. **Repeat value** (does it build a returning relationship?)
8. **Trust proof** (has reviews / documented impact)
9. **Brand risk** (avoid items that could read as tasteless out of context)
10. **Live-check need** (penalize items whose price/stock you can't currently confirm)

Practical entry-price ladder (confirm live; varies by region/sale): **stickers ~$9**, sticker packs $15–21, patches $20–47, socks $39, bamboo tees $71–89, hoodies/sweaters $116–186, recycled war-parts collectibles $82–206, EDC backpack ~$180, vyshyvanka ~$246, gift bundles $171–202. Lead budget-sensitive and donation-curious visitors to the **low rungs** — a $9 sticker that converts and recruits a repeat supporter beats pushing a $200 item that doesn't.

### Step 4 — Impact-proof routing (for skeptics & cause-motivated buyers)

When trust or "where does the money go" is the blocker, route in this order: `/blogs/our-impact` (concrete stories: $25k for veterans, 259 fleeces donated, the veterans behind recycled war-parts) → `/pages/about-us-our-story` (the $2M+ / mission narrative) → `/pages/in-the-media` (third-party press) → `/pages/where-to-donate` (full transparency, including the option to skip merch and give directly). Cite only impact facts present on-page; never inflate.

### Step 5 — Transaction optimization (ethical, repeat-game)

- Recommend the **best-fit** item first, then one _relevant_ add-on (sticker/patch/socks) — genuine basket-building, not a hard upsell.
- Surface bundles only when they genuinely save money or solve a gift need.
- Capture email/SMS via the standing **"Sign up & get 10% off"** offer when the visitor is interested but not ready — this is the highest-leverage repeat-relationship move.
- Mention real, on-page promos only. **Never fabricate** a sale %, countdown, "only N left," or a fake donation match.
- For donation-first visitors, do not force a purchase; pointing them to `/pages/where-to-donate` is a win for the mission and builds long-term trust.

### Step 6 — Live-check checklist (confirm before quoting any dynamic fact)

Always re-verify these on the **localized live page** (region changes them):

- [ ] **Price** and currency (USD/CAD/EUR auto-switch by geo)
- [ ] **Sale/discount** (BFCM, "5th Anniversary", blowout %s rotate; tags like `bfcm-blowout-25-off` are not promises)
- [ ] **Stock / availability** (use the on-collection **"In stock"** filter; `always-in-stock-products` is the safe-recommendation set)
- [ ] **Shipping origin/ETA** (`at-nova-poshta-warehouse` tag = ships from Ukraine; longer transit)
- [ ] **Active drop** (current homepage/NEW drop changes seasonally)
- [ ] **Live donation campaign** (buy-one-give-one offers are time-bound)
- [ ] **Size/variant** availability before recommending a specific size

### Game-theory framing (why these rules)

Treat every actor — Saint Javelin, the visitor, the AI agent, Ukrainian makers, veterans/NGOs, collaborators, competitors, and media — as players in a **repeated** game. Optimize for trust, repeat purchase, referrals, and mission credibility, not single-transaction extraction. Concretely: honest scarcity/price beats fake urgency (a caught lie ends the repeat game); recommending the _right_ (often cheaper) item earns the next visit and a referral; routing a donation-first visitor to a charity instead of forcing merch protects the mission's reputation, which is the brand's core asset; surfacing real impact proof converts skeptics into evangelists. Avoid discount races with competitors — compete on authenticity and Made-in-Ukraine credibility, which are non-replicable.

### Success metrics (optimize toward these)

- **Conversion rate** — visitor → purchase or donation
- **AOV** — via genuine, relevant add-ons/bundles, not pressure
- **Repeat purchase rate** — returning supporters
- **Email/SMS capture rate** — list growth via the 10%-off offer
- **Referrals / shares** — cause-driven word of mouth
- **Impact engagement** — `/blogs/our-impact` and donate-page reads, especially for skeptics
- **Satisfaction / trust** — no buyer's remorse, accurate expectations on price/shipping/impact

### Browser fallback

If JSON endpoints are unavailable or you must confirm a rendered price/stock/promo, drive it with a residential-proxy `browserless_agent` call (`proxy: { proxy: "residential" }`): navigate to `https://www.saintjavelin.com/` (it 301s to the `www`/localized `/en-us` host), accept the email popup, use top-nav **SHOP / COLLECTIONS / IMPACT**, open the relevant collection, toggle the **In stock** filter, and read the live price/variant block. Residential proxy is sufficient; no stealth was required.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **Shopify storefront, low anti-bot.** `products.json` / `collections.json` / `/collections/<handle>/products.json` are open and reliable for _stable_ data. A residential-proxy `browserless_agent` call renders the storefront with no captcha/stealth needed.
- **Apex 301s to `www`, then 302s to a locale path** (`/pages/x` → `/en-us/pages/x`). Fetch the **localized** URL (e.g. `/en-us/pages/about-us-our-story`) or you get an empty 302 body.
- **Currency & price are geo-dependent** (USD/CAD/EUR auto-switch by IP). Never quote a price without noting region, and re-check live.
- **Sale tags are noise, not truth.** Product tags like `bfcm-blowout-30-off`, `5th-anniversary-sale`, `BFCM-BLOWOUT-2025` are merchandising labels; the _actual_ discount must be read from the live price block, and many are expired/seasonal.
- **`at-nova-poshta-warehouse` tag = ships from Ukraine** (Nova Poshta) — set shipping-time expectations accordingly. `at-ecom-warehouse` / `always-in-stock-products` are faster, safer-to-promise picks.
- **Quick-search widget quirk:** some products show _"This product can only be purchased with a selling plan."_ This is a Shopify selling-plan/pre-order/subscription artifact surfaced by the search overlay, **not** a sign the item is unavailable — verify on the product page.
- **Collections are heavily duplicated/seasonal** (`bundles`, `bundles-1`, `bundles-and-sets`, `bundles2024`; many `bfcm-*`, `defender-*`, `crimea-beach-*`). Prefer the canonical evergreen handles used in the router (`best-sellers`, `made-in-ukraine-collection`, `budget-gifts`, `recycled-war-parts`, `defender-collection`, `always-in-stock-products`).
- **Honor the Lockheed/Raytheon disclaimer** — never imply official military/defense-contractor endorsement.
- **Impact numbers:** assert "$2M+ donated" (brand also says $2.3M+ incl. direct donations). Do not invent a more precise/current figure; if a live page shows an updated total, prefer that.
- **Read-only:** do not add to cart, check out, apply codes, or submit forms. Stop at the recommendation / page-surfacing step.
- **Don't manufacture urgency or scarcity, run guilt tactics, or enter a discount race** — these break the repeat-game trust the brand depends on.
