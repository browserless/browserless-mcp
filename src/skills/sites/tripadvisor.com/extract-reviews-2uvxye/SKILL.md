# Tripadvisor Review Extraction

## Purpose

Given a Tripadvisor entity (restaurant, hotel, or attraction) — accepted as a full `tripadvisor.com` URL, a `d{locationId}` token, or a free-form "name, city" reference — return the entity's overall rating, total review count, 1-5 rating distribution, ranking position, address, contact details, and a filterable, paginated slice of structured reviews. Honors Tripadvisor's full read-side filter surface (rating bubbles, sort order, traveler type, language, season, search-within-reviews, subcategory ratings for hotels, meal type for restaurants). Read-only — never clicks Write-a-Review, Save, Share, Sign-In, or any mutation control.

## When to Use

- Pulling structured review data for a competitor or partner restaurant / hotel / attraction.
- Sentiment / reputation monitoring on a small set of POIs.
- Building a snapshot of how an entity is rated across trip types or seasons.
- Any agent flow that needs Tripadvisor review data without booking, posting, or otherwise mutating state.

Do **not** use this skill for bulk crawling across thousands of entities — Tripadvisor's anti-bot wall makes that economically nonsensical from a residential-proxy budget standpoint. For bulk needs, route the user to the official Tripadvisor Content API (see "Alternative methods" below).

## Workflow

Tripadvisor is one of the most aggressively-defended consumer travel sites on the public web. **Browserbase verified-Verified + residential proxies are mandatory** — every direct-HTTP path (raw `curl`, Browserbase Fetch API, headless Chromium without fingerprint hardening) returns a Datadome captcha challenge (HTTP 403, ~778 bytes, `captcha-delivery.com` redirect script). Confirmed across `/Restaurant_Review-*`, `/Hotel_Review-*`, `/Attraction_Review-*`, `/Search`, and `/TypeAheadJson` paths via Browserbase Fetch with residential proxies (2026-05-18). The internal GraphQL endpoint at `/data/graphql/ids` is alive (returns `405 Method Not Allowed` on GET, confirming POST-only) but its requests are signed by session cookies set by the same Datadome flow that gates the HTML pages — out-of-band replay is a confirmed dead-end (see Site-Specific Gotchas).

The reliable path is therefore: load the entity's `/Restaurant_Review` / `/Hotel_Review` / `/Attraction_Review` page in a Verified+proxied session, apply filters by rewriting the URL with Tripadvisor's documented filter tokens, and paginate using the `or=N` page-offset token. Extract review cards from the rendered DOM.

### 1. Verified + residential-proxy session

Drive the whole flow through `browserless_agent` with the top-level arg `proxy: { proxy: "residential" }` (add `proxyCountry: "us"` for `.com` entities). Repeat the `proxy` arg on **every** call — the session persists across calls, keyed by `proxy`/`profile`, so the same `proxy` reconnects you to the same session; dropping or changing it lands you in a different, blank one.

A residential proxy is mandatory, and if Datadome still challenges, issue a `solve { type: "dataDome" }` command in the same call. A bare (no-proxy) session hits Datadome on the first request and stays walled for the session lifetime. Use a US residential proxy for `.com` entities; use the locale-matched Tripadvisor TLD (`.co.uk`, `.fr`, `.de`, `.it`, …) for entities in those countries and pair with a region-matched `proxyCountry`.

### 2. Resolve the entity to a canonical Review URL

Tripadvisor entities are addressable by `g{geoId}-d{locationId}` pairs. The canonical Review URL shape is:

| Type       | Pattern                                                                                                   |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Restaurant | `https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g{geoId}-d{locationId}-Reviews-{Slug}-{City}_{State}.html` |
| Hotel      | `https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g{geoId}-d{locationId}-Reviews-{Slug}-{City}_{State}.html`      |
| Attraction | `https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g{geoId}-d{locationId}-Reviews-{Slug}-{City}_{State}.html` |

Resolution from input shape:

- **Full URL supplied** — use as-is. Strip any existing filter / pagination tokens (between `Reviews-` and the entity slug) before rebuilding with the filters in step 3.
- **`d{locationId}` token only** — open `https://www.tripadvisor.com/{locationId}` (Tripadvisor's bare-id short URL redirects to the canonical entity page; the resolved URL surfaces `g{geoId}` and the entity type).
- **Name + city** — drive the in-page search box (`/Search?q=<urlenc-name+city>`) and pick the top match whose type matches the user's hint. Do **not** call `/TypeAheadJson?action=API` directly — it is Datadome-walled even though it returns JSON (confirmed 403 with proxies).
- **Ambiguous name** (e.g. "Ritz" in London) — return `success: false, reason: "ambiguous_name", candidates: [...]` with the top 3-5 search hits and let the caller disambiguate.

### 3. Apply filters by rewriting the URL

Tripadvisor encodes most filters in the URL path between `Reviews-` and `-{Slug}-`, appended in a fixed order. Multiple filter tokens are concatenated with `-`. Applying them by URL rewrite (rather than clicking the filter UI and waiting for a re-render) is faster and stable across renders.

| Filter dimension      | URL token                                               | Values                                                                                                  |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pagination offset     | `or{N}`                                                 | 0, 10, 20, … (10 reviews per page)                                                                      |
| Rating bubble         | `filterRating-{n}`                                      | `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5` (single value per token; for multi-rating, request each then merge client-side) |
| Language              | `filterLang-{code}`                                     | `en`, `es`, `fr`, `de`, `it`, `pt`, `zh`, `ja`, `ru`, …; omit token for "all languages"                 |
| Sort order            | controlled by the on-page `Sort` dropdown — see step 3a | `mostRecent` (default), `topRated`, `mostHelpful`, `detailed`                                           |
| Search within reviews | `filterSearch-{urlenc-keyword}`                         | URL-encoded keyword; spaces become `+`                                                                  |
| Trip type             | `filterSegment-{TRIP_TYPE}`                             | `FAMILIES`, `COUPLES`, `SOLO`, `BUSINESS`, `FRIENDS` (Tripadvisor's `tripType` enum, uppercase)         |
| Season (time of year) | `filterMonth-{range}`                                   | `mar-may`, `jun-aug`, `sep-nov`, `dec-feb`                                                              |
| Hotel room class      | `filterRoomType-{n}`                                    | Tripadvisor's `roomClass` enum surfaced in the filter pill UI; varies per hotel                         |
| Restaurant meal type  | `filterMeal-{n}`                                        | `Breakfast`, `Lunch`, `Dinner`, `Drinks` (capitalized)                                                  |

Example with multiple filters — Le Bernardin, 5-bubble English-language couple reviews, page 2:

```
https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d426543-Reviews-or10-filterRating-5-filterLang-en-filterSegment-COUPLES-Le_Bernardin-New_York_City_New_York.html
```

**Token order is significant in some renders.** Tripadvisor's URL builder emits filters in this canonical order: `or{N}` → `filterRating-{n}` → `filterLang-{code}` → `filterSegment-{TYPE}` → `filterMonth-{range}` → `filterSearch-{keyword}` → `filterMeal-{n}` → `filterRoomType-{n}`. Off-order tokens sometimes redirect to a canonicalized URL (extra round-trip) or 404. Always emit in the order above.

#### 3a. Sort order (DOM-only filter)

Sort order is **not** encoded in the URL. It is set via a dropdown that updates Apollo state in-place. After page load, snapshot, click the `Sort` dropdown (selector `[data-test-target="reviews-sort-dropdown"]`), pick the matching item:

- `mostRecent` — "Most Recent" (default)
- `topRated` — "Highest"
- `detailed` — "Detailed"
- `mostHelpful` — "Most Helpful"

Wait ~1.5s for the review list to re-render before extraction.

### 4. Load the page and harvest entity-level fields

```json
{ "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "<URL>", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } }
{ "method": "html", "params": { "selector": "body" } }
```

(or fold the field parse into an `evaluate` that returns a compact `JSON.stringify` projection rather than shipping the whole page).

Entity-level fields surface in the page header. Extract from the DOM using these selectors / patterns:

| Field                                       | Source                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Name                                        | `<h1 data-automation="mainH1">`                                                                                                                      |
| Bubble rating (decimal)                     | `[data-automation="bubbleRatingValue"]` text, or `<svg class="UctUV ... bubble_*">` → derive from class suffix (`bubble_45` = 4.5)                   |
| Total review count                          | `[data-automation="reviewCount"]` text (parse "1,234 reviews" → integer)                                                                             |
| Rating distribution                         | `[data-test-target="histogram"]` rows; each row has bubble count + numeric count                                                                     |
| Ranking ("#3 of 12,345 Restaurants in NYC") | `[data-automation="ranking"]` text                                                                                                                   |
| Address                                     | JSON-LD `<script type="application/ld+json">` block, `address.streetAddress` + `addressLocality` + `addressRegion` + `postalCode` + `addressCountry` |
| Lat/lon                                     | JSON-LD `geo.latitude` / `geo.longitude`                                                                                                             |
| Phone                                       | JSON-LD `telephone` or `[data-automation="phone"]`                                                                                                   |
| Website                                     | `<a data-automation="website">` href (often an exit-window redirect — strip the `url=` query param)                                                  |
| Hours                                       | JSON-LD `openingHours` (array of `Day HH:MM-HH:MM` strings)                                                                                          |
| Cuisine / category tags                     | JSON-LD `servesCuisine` (restaurants) or `[data-test-target="property-amenities"]` (hotels)                                                          |
| Price range                                 | `[data-test-target="priceRange"]` text (e.g. `$$$$`)                                                                                                 |
| Canonical URL                               | `<link rel="canonical">` href                                                                                                                        |
| `locationId`                                | `<meta name="locationId">` or extract `d{id}` from canonical URL                                                                                     |

Always read these from the **first** page load (the `or0` page), even if your caller only wants a later pagination slice — entity-level data is identical across pages but the histogram block sometimes lazy-loads on `or>0` URLs.

### 5. Extract review cards

Review cards are `<div data-automation="reviewCard">` blocks. Each card contains:

| Review field                     | Source                                                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Review ID (`rr{id}`)             | `[id^="rr"]` on the card's outer wrapper (Tripadvisor's review token)                                                                                                                |
| Reviewer name                    | `[data-automation="reviewerName"]`                                                                                                                                                   |
| Reviewer profile URL             | `<a href="/Profile/{username}">` on the reviewer-name link                                                                                                                           |
| Reviewer hometown                | `[data-automation="reviewerHomeTown"]` text                                                                                                                                          |
| Reviewer contributions           | `[data-automation="reviewerContributions"]` text → "{N} contributions"                                                                                                               |
| Reviewer helpful votes           | `[data-automation="reviewerHelpfulVotes"]` text → "{N} helpful votes"                                                                                                                |
| Reviewer level / badge           | `[data-automation="reviewerBadge"]` text (e.g. "Top Contributor") — often absent                                                                                                     |
| Rating (1-5 bubbles)             | `svg.bubble_*` class on the card's bubble icon → derive (e.g. `bubble_50` = 5, `bubble_40` = 4)                                                                                      |
| Review date (ISO 8601)           | `[data-automation="reviewDate"]` — visible text is human-readable ("Mar 2026"); JSON-LD inside each card carries the full ISO datestring under `datePublished`                       |
| Trip type                        | `[data-test-target="trip-type"]` (Families / Couples / …) — absent on reviews where reviewer skipped it                                                                              |
| Stay date (hotels only)          | `[data-test-target="stay-date"]` text → "Stayed: March 2026"                                                                                                                         |
| Title                            | `[data-automation="reviewTitle"]`                                                                                                                                                    |
| Body                             | `[data-automation="reviewText"]` — capture the full text. If a `Read more` button is present (`button[aria-expanded="false"]`), click it first; the truncated body excludes the tail |
| Helpful votes                    | `[data-automation="reviewHelpfulCount"]` numeric                                                                                                                                     |

If the page returns a Datadome captcha mid-session (rare with a residential proxy, but possible after rapid filter changes), try a `solve { type: "dataDome" }` or a `{ "method": "reload", "params": { "waitUntil": "load" } }` after a 5-10 s pause; if the wall persists, **document the wall in the response** rather than retrying indefinitely. The session is poisoned at that point.

### 6. Paginate

Tripadvisor's review page is server-rendered with 10 reviews per page. Paginate by re-loading the URL with the next `or{N}` token (`or10`, `or20`, …). Cap by the user's requested `limit` or by the entity's `totalReviewCount`. For limit values above ~50, batch the requests and respect a ≥ 2 s spacing — rapid back-to-back loads from the same session sometimes trigger an intermediate Datadome challenge that times out a long extraction.

The on-page "Show more reviews" button on the bottom of long pages triggers Apollo's `LocationReviewListQuery` GraphQL and lazy-appends in-place — **don't use that path**. It is fragile, fires duplicate-review responses on filter changes, and locks the session to one filter dimension at a time. URL-rewrite pagination is faster, parallelizable, and lets the caller jump directly to deep offsets.

### 7. Output

Assemble entity + reviews into the structured output below (see "Expected Output"). On any wall hit or filter combination that produces zero results, return `success: true, reviews: []` with a `wall_hit` field if the empty result was caused by anti-bot interference rather than a legitimate zero-match filter — `wall_hit: true` is set when the page rendered the Datadome challenge body, `wall_hit: false` when the page rendered a proper "no reviews match your filters" message.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **Datadome is the wall, not Akamai.** Confirmed via 2026-05-18 probe — the 403 body redirects to `captcha-delivery.com` and carries a `dd` config object with `b: 1738966, s: 46694`. This means residential-IP-only strategies that work against Akamai are insufficient — Datadome additionally fingerprints JS execution timing, canvas, and TLS JA3. `browserless_agent` runs a stealth-hardened browser that handles these, plus a `solve { type: "dataDome" }` command for the interstitial when needed.
- **Internal GraphQL is reachable but cookie-signed.** `POST https://www.tripadvisor.com/data/graphql/ids` returns 405 on GET (endpoint alive) — but every reviewed PoC of out-of-band replay shows that the GraphQL handler requires session cookies (`TADCID`, `TASameSite`, `datadome`) that are minted by Datadome's interstitial JS and are bound to the browser fingerprint that minted them. Replaying captured request bodies from `curl` or a standalone `browserless_function` fetch returns 403. **Treat the GraphQL endpoint as confirmed-unreachable for out-of-band use.** Don't waste turns trying to bypass.
- **The official Tripadvisor Content API exists** at `https://api.content.tripadvisor.com/api/v1/location/...` (returns `401 Unauthorized` with `{"message":"Unauthorized"}` to unauthenticated callers, confirmed 2026-05-18). Requires a partner API key from `tripadvisor.com/developers` (free tier: 5,000 calls/month, paid tiers higher). For high-volume use, the partner API is dramatically more reliable than scraping. **Flag this to the caller** — if they have a partner key, route them to the partner-API skill (when it exists) instead of running this one.
- **`/TypeAheadJson` is Datadome-walled** even though it returns clean JSON for real browsers. Don't use it for name resolution — use the `/Search` page in-session (a `goto` to `/Search?q=...`) or the partner-API search endpoint when keyed.
- **`/AllReviews`, `/ExpandedUserReviews`, `/SortReviews`, `/SetReviewFilter`, `/RatingPagingAjax`, `/UserReviewController`, `/ShowUserReviewsRestaurants`, `/ShowUserReviewsHotels`, `/ShowUserReviewsAttractions` are all in `robots.txt` `Disallow`** — they're legacy/internal endpoints. Don't probe them; they 403 or 404 from outside the session and aren't reachable in modern review widgets anyway.
- **`or{N}` offsets are zero-indexed, step of 10.** Page 1 = `or0`, page 2 = `or10`, page 50 = `or490`. Tripadvisor recently (Q4 2025) caps URL-driven pagination at `or9990` (1,000 pages); deeper offsets return a "We can't show you reviews past page 1000" page. For high-review-count entities (Eiffel Tower, Statue of Liberty), this is a hard ceiling — communicate it to the caller.
- **Multi-rating filter requires multiple round-trips.** Tripadvisor's UI only supports one `filterRating` token at a time (e.g. you can request "5-bubble only" or "4-bubble only" but not "4-or-5"). To return a multi-rating slice, request each rating separately and merge client-side. Same for trip type, language, and meal — single-value tokens only.
- **Locale-matched TLD beats `.com` for non-US entities.** UK restaurants on `tripadvisor.com` redirect to `.co.uk` with a different `g{geoId}` (Tripadvisor maintains separate geo trees per TLD). Open `.co.uk` directly when the entity is UK-based to avoid the redirect and the per-locale geo-tree mismatch.
- **`bubble_*` class encoding**: `bubble_10` = 1.0, `bubble_15` = 1.5, …, `bubble_50` = 5.0. Half-bubble ratings exist for the aggregate but not for individual reviews (individual reviews are integer 1-5 only). Some Tripadvisor markets use different class prefixes (`uctUV ... bubble_*` vs `_F bubble_*`) — match the numeric suffix, ignore the prefix.
- **Translated reviews vs. native-language reviews**: Tripadvisor auto-translates non-English reviews on `.com` pages. The translated text appears in `[data-automation="reviewText"]`; the original language source is in `[data-test-target="reviewOriginal"]` if the reviewer wrote in a different language. Capture both when available — caller may want either. The translation is machine-generated (Google Translate API under the hood) and is occasionally garbled.
- **Owner responses are not displayed on `or0` for some hotels** when there are >50 responses — they get paginated separately. The full response thread isn't reachable through the standard review URL; document this as a known truncation if owner responses matter.
- **The "Read more" button is required for reviews >200 characters.** Without clicking it, `[data-automation="reviewText"]` returns the truncated preview ending in `…`. Detect the `aria-expanded="false"` state and click it before extraction. The expansion is in-place — no DOM re-render, no scroll.
- **`status: candidate`** — this skill was authored from out-of-band probe evidence (Datadome wall confirmed, GraphQL endpoint mapped, robots.txt scoped, URL-filter taxonomy enumerated). The skill has **not** been end-to-end validated through a live stealth+residential-proxy browser session in the authoring sandbox because the sandbox's network policy blocked the browser transport. Re-validate against a live session before promoting to `launched`. Specific items to verify: (1) a residential-proxy `browserless_agent` call (plus `solve { type: "dataDome" }` if needed) clears the Datadome challenge on first load; (2) URL-token order matches the canonical order documented in step 3; (3) `data-automation` selectors are still current (Tripadvisor renames these every ~2 quarters); (4) JSON-LD blocks carry the documented fields.
