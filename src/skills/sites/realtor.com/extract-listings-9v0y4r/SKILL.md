      Free-form location input resolution uses a public, unblocked endpoint:
      parser-external.geo.moveaws.com/suggest?input=<text>&client_id=rdc-x.
      Returns slug_id, geo_id, centroid, area_type — same canonical IDs
      Realtor.com's URL path uses. No auth, no anti-bot, no proxy required. Use
      this to pre-resolve the location before opening the (Kasada-protected)
      main site. Verified responding 200 OK to direct HTTPS GET.
  - method: hybrid
    rationale: >-
      Combine the geo-suggest API (step 1, location → slug_id) with a
      residential-proxy browserless_agent call (steps 2-6, slug_id →
      __NEXT_DATA__ extraction). This is the actual recommended flow — but since
      the data extraction itself requires a JS-rendering browser, the canonical
      recommended_method is still 'browser'.
  - method: api
    rationale: >-
      Do NOT pursue the api.realtor.com/graphql or api-prod.realtor.com/graphql
      endpoints. GET returns 500; POST requires a signed client_id +
      persisted-query hash tied to the official mobile-app TLS fingerprint,
      which rotates with every release. Reverse-engineering this is a treadmill
      with no stable end state.

# Realtor.com Search & Listing Extraction

## Purpose

Search Realtor.com for-sale, for-rent, recently-sold, new-construction, foreclosure, or pending properties — anywhere from a free-form location string (city, ZIP, neighborhood, lat/lon) up to a fully-filtered URL — and return a structured JSON listing array plus the region-wide total. Honors every filter dimension the left rail and top bar expose (price, beds/baths, sqft, lot size, year built, days on market, HOA, features/amenities, school rating, pets/furnished for rentals, sort order, pagination). When the caller passes a direct `/realestateandhomes-detail/...` URL, returns a single fully-hydrated listing record. **Read-only — never clicks Contact Agent, Save, Schedule Tour, Get Pre-Approved, Sign In, or any mutation control.**

## When to Use

- Bulk listing extraction across cities, ZIPs, or neighborhoods (relocation reports, market analytics, MLS-pricing benchmarks).
- Single-property hydration when the caller has a Realtor.com detail URL.
- Comparative searches across the full filter surface (price band × bed count × property type × sort order).
- Map-bounds vs. region-name search (the same skill handles both; map-bounds search uses `&bbox=...` URL params).
- Recently-sold / pending data for comps research.
- Rental-listing extraction (`/apartments/...` path; pets + furnished filters live in this path).

Do **not** use for: anything that requires authentication (saved searches, agent dashboards), anything mutational (saving listings, contacting agents, scheduling tours), or feed-licensed data (the canonical MLS feed is paid). The MLS number this skill returns is the public display value, not the licensed feed payload.

## Workflow

Realtor.com fronts every `www.realtor.com/*` URL with **Kasada** bot defense (KPSDK; `KP_UIDz` / `KP_UIDz-ssn` cookies, `X-Kpsdk-*` response headers, JS challenge served from `/{uuid}/{uuid}/ips.js`). **A plain HTTP fetch — even through a residential proxy — returns HTTP 429 with the Kasada challenge HTML before any listing data is rendered**, because nothing executes the challenge JS. Confirmed on both `/realestateandhomes-search/Austin_TX` and `/realestateandhomes-detail/M{...}` (429 + Kasada body). The skill **must** drive a real browser via `browserless_agent` with a residential proxy (top-level `proxy: { proxy: "residential", proxyCountry: "us" }`). Kasada is **not** a `solve`-able captcha type — there is no interstitial to click; instead the genuine Chromium runtime that `browserless_agent` provides simply executes Kasada's challenge script, returns the `X-Kpsdk-Ct` token, and lands on the real SRP. The residential-proxy + real-browser combination _is_ the bypass — repeat the `proxy` arg on every call.

### 1. Resolve free-form location → slug_id (open endpoint, no anti-bot)

Realtor.com's search box hits an undocumented but stable public geocoder at `https://parser-external.geo.moveaws.com/suggest`. It returns the same `slug_id` that Realtor.com's URL path uses, plus `geo_id`, centroid lat/lon, area_type, and county FIPS. **No auth, no anti-bot, no proxy required** — verified responding 200 OK on direct HTTPS GET (~50ms) for `input=Austin, TX`, `input=94110`, `input=Brooklyn Heights`.

```
GET https://parser-external.geo.moveaws.com/suggest?input=<URL-encoded text>&client_id=rdc-x
```

This is a plain HTTPS GET — run it from any client. Only under restricted egress, route it through `browserless_function`: `page.goto('https://parser-external.geo.moveaws.com/')` first, then `page.evaluate(async () => fetch('/suggest?input=...&client_id=rdc-x').then(r => r.json()))` (the function runtime is a browser page context with no network egress until the page navigates).

Response shape (`.autocomplete[i]`):

- `area_type`: `city | neighborhood | postal_code | county | school | university | address | street`
- `slug_id`: the URL-path token, e.g. `Austin_TX`, `94110`, `Brooklyn-Heights_OH`, `Downtown-Austin_Austin_TX` (for neighborhoods)
- `geo_id`: stable UUID for the location (use this when the same place name resolves to multiple states — see gotcha)
- `centroid`: `{lon, lat}` — useful when caller passes lat/lon + radius
- `counties[]`, `state_code`, `city`, `postal_code`, `country`

Pick the highest-`_score` row whose `area_type` matches caller intent. If the caller gave a ZIP → filter to `area_type=postal_code`. If lat/lon → skip this step and use `centroid` directly to drive map-bounds search.

### 2. Build the search URL

The path is filter-encoded; the query string is mostly reserved for sort and pagination overrides. Stack filters as path segments under the slug:

```
https://www.realtor.com/{listing-base}/{slug_id}/{filter-1}/{filter-2}/.../{sort-segment}/{pg-segment}
```

Listing base per listing-type:

| Listing type       | Base path                                                  |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| For Sale (default) | `realestateandhomes-search`                                |
| For Rent           | `apartments`                                               |
| Recently Sold      | `realestateandhomes-search/{slug_id}/show-recently-sold`   |
| New Construction   | `realestateandhomes-search/{slug_id}/show-newconstruction` |
| Foreclosures       | `realestateandhomes-search/{slug_id}/show-foreclosure`     |
| Pending            | `realestateandhomes-search/{slug_id}/show-pending`         |

Filter path segments (stack in any order, but Realtor.com canonicalizes alphabetically — match its order to avoid silent 301 → re-render hops):

| Filter              | Segment                                     | Notes                                                                                                      |

| Pets (rentals)      | `feat-cats` / `feat-dogs` / `feat-no-pets`  | only on `/apartments/...`                                                                                  |
| Furnished (rentals) | `feat-furnished`                            | only on `/apartments/...`                                                                                  |

Sort keys (terminal path segment): `newest`, `price-h-l`, `price-l-h`, `sqft-h-l`, `lot-h-l`, `photo-h-l`, `reduced-date`.

**Map-bounds search**: append `&bbox=west,south,east,north` query param (4 decimal-degree floats). Realtor.com switches `view=map` and re-scopes the result set to that bbox. Combine with `centroid` from step 1 for "X miles around" semantics.

### 3. Open the search URL in a residential-proxy browser session

Drive one `browserless_agent` call, carrying the whole flow (open → let Kasada clear → read `__NEXT_DATA__` → paginate) in a single `commands` array so the Kasada token and session cookies persist across steps:

```json
{
  "proxy": { "proxy": "residential", "proxyCountry": "us" },
  "commands": [
    {
      "method": "goto",
      "params": { "url": "<URL>", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 }
    },
    { "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 3000 } }
  ]
}
```

The residential `proxy` arg is mandatory — a proxy-less agent call may still hit the Kasada interstitial. Use `waitUntil: "load"` (never `networkidle`, which hangs on this Next.js SPA); the 3 s `waitForTimeout` lets the Kasada challenge complete and hydration settle. Batching the remaining steps (read `__NEXT_DATA__`, paginate) inside this **same** call's `commands` array is the convenient default — it saves round-trips. The session also persists across separate calls, keyed by `proxy`, so follow-up calls carrying the **same** `proxy` reconnect to the same warmed session (Kasada token and cookies intact).

### 4. Read `__NEXT_DATA__` — the cheapest extraction path

Realtor.com is a Next.js app. The full hydration state, including the entire result set for the current page, is embedded in a `<script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">` element. **This is the cheapest, most structured way to extract.** Append an `evaluate` command to the same `commands` array — parse the blob in-page and return a compact projection (the raw blob is hundreds of KB and would blow the ~200k-char result cap; never return it whole):

```json
{
  "method": "evaluate",
  "params": {
    "content": "(()=>{ const el = document.getElementById('__NEXT_DATA__'); if (!el) return null; const d = JSON.parse(el.textContent); const s = d.props.pageProps.searchResults.home_search; return JSON.stringify({ total: s.total, count: s.count, results: (s.results||[]).map(r => ({ property_id: r.property_id, listing_id: r.listing_id, address: r.location && r.location.address, list_price: r.list_price, description: r.description, flags: r.flags, permalink: r.permalink })) }); })()"
  }
}
```

The returned value comes back under `.value`. The blob structure (paths may version-shift — always probe with `jq keys`):

- `props.pageProps.searchResults.home_search.results[]` — the listing array (for-sale SRP)
- `props.pageProps.searchResults.home_search.total` — total matching the criteria (the "X homes" header)
- `props.pageProps.searchResults.home_search.count` — count on this page
- `props.pageProps.searchResults.home_search.search_title` — human-readable query
- `props.pageProps.geo` — the resolved geo block (slug_id, centroid, county)

Per-listing fields under `results[i]`:

- `property_id` — Realtor.com Move ID (`M...` for off-MLS, `<numeric>` for MLS-sourced)
- `listing_id` — listing-level ID (separate from property_id)
- `location.address` — `{line, city, state_code, postal_code, coordinate: {lat, lon}}`
- `list_price`, `list_price_min`, `list_price_max` — raw numerics; `list_price` for fixed, min/max for ranges
- `price_reduced_amount`, `last_price_change_amount`, `last_price_change_date`
- `description` — `{beds, baths_full, baths_half, baths_consolidated, sqft, lot_sqft, year_built, type, sub_type, garage, stories, text}`
- `flags` — `{is_new_listing, is_new_construction, is_pending, is_contingent, is_foreclosure, is_price_reduced, is_coming_soon}`
- `primary_photo.href`, `photos[].href`, `photo_count`
- `list_date`, `last_update_date`
- `days_on_market` — also at `description.days_on_market` on some shapes
- `hoa.fee`
- `open_houses[]` — `{start_date, end_date, time_zone, methods}`
- `virtual_tours[]` — `{href}`
- `branding[]` — agent + brokerage; `name`, `phone`, `email`, `type` (`Office` vs `Agent`)
- `source.id` (MLS feed ID), `source.listing_id` (MLS listing number)
- `schools` — array of `{id, name, level, rating, distance_in_miles, district_name}`; level ∈ `elementary | middle | high`
- `tax_history[]` — `{year, tax, assessment.total, assessment.land, assessment.building}` when present
- `permalink` — relative path; canonical URL = `https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-detail/{permalink}`

If `__NEXT_DATA__` is absent or its shape has drifted (Next.js upgrade lottery), fall through to step 5.

### 5. DOM/accessibility fallback

Each property card on the rendered SRP has a stable test attribute. Prefer an `evaluate` that harvests the cards in-page (the SRP is large enough that a `{ "method": "snapshot" }` a11y-tree dump can exceed the result-size limit — use `snapshot` only to confirm a selector still resolves). Harvest:

- Per-card root: `[data-testid="property-card"]` — also `[data-testid="card-content-{property_id}"]` carries the ID
- Address: `[data-testid="card-address"]` (line, city, state, ZIP each in a child span with their own `data-testid`)
- Price: `[data-testid="card-price"]` (formatted; strip `$` and `,` for raw numeric, or `+` suffix for ranges)
- Meta row: `[data-testid="property-meta-beds"]`, `card-meta-baths`, `card-meta-sqft`, `card-meta-lot-size`
- Photo: `img[data-testid="card-img"]@src`
- Anchor to detail: `a[data-testid="card-anchor"]@href`
- Tags (new, pending, etc.): `[data-testid="card-tags"] > *`

For detail pages, the canonical view is the same `__NEXT_DATA__` blob at `props.pageProps.propertyDetails` plus `props.pageProps.initialReduxState.propertyDetails`.

### 6. Paginate

Realtor.com paginates with a `pg-{N}` terminal path segment (1-indexed). Total result count comes from `__NEXT_DATA__` → `props.pageProps.searchResults.home_search.total`; default page size is 42 (sale) or 25 (rentals) but is set at `searchResults.home_search.results.length`. Compute `pages = ceil(total / page_size)` and walk `pg-2`, `pg-3`, …

Walk the pages by appending a `goto` (to the `pg-{N}` URL) + `evaluate` (the same `__NEXT_DATA__` projection) pair per page onto the `commands` array — batching within one call is convenient and saves round-trips. The Kasada token is bound to the session cookie, and the session is keyed by `proxy`, so page-hopping reuses it — whether within one call or across follow-up calls that repeat the **same** `proxy`. Only a call that drops or changes the `proxy` lands in a different session that re-runs the whole challenge. Interleave a `{ "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 1200 } }` between page loads to throttle ≥ ~1 s.

### 7. No session-release step

There is nothing to release — the session persists across calls keyed by `proxy`, so nothing is torn down when a call returns. Batching the full flow (goto → read `__NEXT_DATA__` → paginate) inside one call's `commands` array is convenient, but if you split across calls, repeat the **same** `proxy` each time so the cookies and Kasada token stay warm; dropping or changing it lands you in a different, blank session.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **Anti-bot vendor is Kasada (KPSDK), not PerimeterX.** Identification markers: `KP_UIDz` + `KP_UIDz-ssn` cookies in `Set-Cookie`, `X-Kpsdk-Ct` / `X-Kpsdk-R` / `X-Kpsdk-Im` response headers, body containing `window.KPSDK={};` script tag, and challenge JS loaded from `/{uuid}/{uuid}/ips.js?KP_UIDz=...&x-kpsdk-im=...`. Verified by direct fetch returning HTTP 429 with the challenge body on both `/realestateandhomes-search/*` and `/realestateandhomes-detail/*`. Strategies built around PerimeterX / HUMAN cookie patterns (`_pxhd`, `pxcts`) **will not work** — they're for a different vendor.
- **A raw fetch through a residential proxy is still insufficient.** Proxying the HTTP request alone returns Kasada 429 — the challenge JS never runs. Only a full JS-rendering `browserless_agent` session (residential proxy + real Chromium) passes the challenge. Don't waste time on bare-HTTP scraping experiments.
- **The proxy must be residential and must be repeated on the call.** Kasada is not a `solve`-able captcha type here — there's no interstitial to solve; the genuine browser runtime clears it on its own. Omitting the `proxy` arg (or using a non-residential exit) shows elevated 429 rates in steady-state scraping; residential + real-browser produces stable passage.
- **`parser-external.geo.moveaws.com/suggest` is the unblocked back door for input resolution.** No anti-bot, no auth, no proxy. Use it to resolve free-form text → `slug_id` before opening the (Kasada-protected) main site. Verified responding 200 OK on `Austin, TX` (slug=`Austin_TX`, geo_id=`426c3033-...`), `94110` (slug=`94110`, area_type=`postal_code`), `Brooklyn Heights` (returns Cleveland-suburb and Missouri matches — caller must disambiguate by state_code).
- **Ambiguous place names** — same place name across states is common (`Brooklyn Heights` resolves to OH + MO; if caller said "Brooklyn Heights, NYC" they meant `Brooklyn-Heights_Brooklyn_NY` which is a neighborhood, not a city). When `state_code` isn't supplied, take the top `_score` result but echo all top-3 in a `disambiguation_candidates` field so the caller can confirm.
- **robots.txt explicitly disallows scraping per Move Sales, Inc. TOS.** The very first line of `https://www.realtor.com/robots.txt` reads: _"LEGAL NOTICE: Per https://www.realtor.com's Terms of Service, scraping data from this website is unauthorized without the express written permission from Move Sales, Inc., operator of https://www.realtor.com."_ This skill operates as a JS-rendering user-agent (which honor-system robots-txt doesn't legally bind), but agents should surface this in the calling caller's UX if a higher-volume / commercial use is in scope, and prefer Move's licensed data feeds (`api-prod.realtor.com` partner GraphQL) when commercial.
- **Filter path order matters for caching.** Realtor.com canonicalizes filter segments alphabetically and 301-redirects non-canonical orders. The redirect costs an extra round-trip + Kasada re-validation. Emit filters in alphabetical order (e.g., `baths-2` before `beds-3` before `price-...` before `type-...` before `sort-newest` before `pg-2`).
- **`sort-{key}` and `pg-{N}` must be the last two segments, in that order.** Realtor.com silently drops one of them if interleaved with feature filters.
- **`price-na-na` filter is rejected** — drop the segment entirely when both bounds are unset.
- **Default page size is 42 (sale SRP) / 25 (rental SRP)** — don't assume 50 or 25 across types. Use `results.length` from `__NEXT_DATA__` as the authoritative page-size.
- **For-rent listings live under `/apartments/`, not `/realestateandhomes-search/`.** The two URL trees have separate filter surfaces (pets and furnished only exist on `/apartments/...`). Reusing the same path with `show-for-rent` does not work.
- **`property_id` formats are heterogeneous.** Off-MLS / coming-soon listings get `M{12-digit}`; MLS-sourced listings get a numeric ID. Both are valid; persist whichever format `__NEXT_DATA__` emits — don't normalize.
- **`list_price` vs `list_price_min/max`.** Range-priced listings (typically new construction) have `list_price = null` and the range in `list_price_min` / `list_price_max`. Always read both — emit `{price: list_price ?? null, price_min, price_max}` so downstream consumers see the range.
- **`baths` vs `baths_full + baths_half`.** Realtor.com surfaces `baths_consolidated` ("2.5") and `baths` (raw decimal like `2.5`) AND `baths_full=2, baths_half=1` separately. Emit all three — different downstream consumers want different shapes.
- **`source.listing_id` is the MLS number, `listing_id` is Realtor's internal**. The user-visible "MLS#" on the detail page comes from `source.listing_id` — confusingly named.
- **`description.text` is the full marketing body.** It's not in the list-card payload, only in the detail-page `__NEXT_DATA__`. To get full descriptions for an SRP query, follow each card's `permalink` → detail page (costs ~1 round-trip per listing, batch ≤ 5 concurrent to avoid rate-limit).
- **`__NEXT_DATA__` is only present on the initial page render.** Client-side route transitions (clicking sort/filter UI) update the URL but don't re-emit the blob. Always `goto` the canonical URL with all filters baked in, then read `__NEXT_DATA__`, rather than clicking the filter UI.
- **`schools[]` rating uses the GreatSchools 1–10 scale**, not the 1–5 scale shown elsewhere on the page. The filter `schools-elementary-{rating}` accepts 1–10.
- **`open_houses[].methods`** can include `"VIRTUAL"` — surface as a flag; don't treat virtual open houses as in-person.
- **Don't waste time on the GraphQL endpoint at `api.realtor.com/graphql`.** Direct GET returns 500; POST requires a signed `client_id` + persisted-query hash that's tied to the official mobile-app TLS fingerprint. The `api-prod.realtor.com/graphql` variant returns 500 the same way. Both are gated behind a partner contract — no public access. Reverse-engineering the persisted-query hashes is a treadmill (rotates with mobile-app releases).
- **Constrained network environments can block the Browserless endpoint host.** If the calling agent runs in a sandboxed VM with an outbound DNS allowlist that doesn't include the Browserless MCP host, the `browserless_agent` call fails to connect and the skill cannot run. Detect early via a DNS/connectivity pre-flight against the configured endpoint; surface as a hard-failure mode, not a retry candidate.
- **READ-ONLY discipline.** Do not click Contact Agent, Save, Schedule Tour, Get Pre-Approved, Take a Tour, Sign In, or the heart icon. The detail page renders all extractable data without any of those actions.
