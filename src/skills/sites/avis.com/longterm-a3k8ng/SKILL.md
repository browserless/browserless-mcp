# Avis Long-Term Rental Search

## Purpose

Given a US Avis pickup/dropoff location, a date range of 15–330 days, and a renter age, drive the Avis.com booking widget through to the vehicle-results screen and return one of these shapes per location:

- success — vehicles + per-class daily/total prices (pay-now and pay-later), with the cheapest deal flagged.
- captcha-wall — `success: false, reason: "human_press_and_hold"` with the PerimeterX Reference ID.
- unsupported-range — `success: false, reason: "range_outside_15_to_330_days"`.
- no-availability — `success: true, vehicles: [], sold_out: true`.

**Read-only. Stop at the vehicle-results / fleet-selection screen.** Never click "Book Now", "Pay Now", "Continue to Extras", or any booking-completion button. Designed to be looped across many locations to surface unusually cheap long-term deals.

## When to Use

- Bulk-scan many US Avis locations (airports + city pickups) for monthly / 6–12 month rentals to identify outlier prices.
- "What's the cheapest 6-month rental in Phoenix vs Las Vegas vs Albuquerque starting July 1?"
- Long-term rental comparison tools that need pay-now vs pay-later breakdowns.
- Any flow that needs Avis prices without booking. Reservation completion is a different skill.

## Workflow

Avis renders the booking widget with React/Next.js, has no documented public API, and aggressively gates the search submission with the **HUMAN (PerimeterX) "Press & Hold" CAPTCHA**. Browser-driving via `browserless_agent` is the only available surface; the GraphQL-looking endpoints under `/api/` return CAPTCHA HTML to anonymous callers (confirmed). Plan for ~30–60% of submissions to land on the CAPTCHA wall even with a stealthed session + residential `proxy` — the skill treats that as a real outcome shape, not a failure, and the caller loops with backoff + fresh calls.

### 1. Per-location call: stealth + residential proxy (mandatory)

Run the entire per-location flow — open, dismiss modals, pick location, set dates, submit, read results — as **one** `browserless_agent` call with a residential `proxy` (`proxy: { proxy: "residential" }`), so the widget state and cookies persist across the steps. The session persists across calls, keyed by `proxy`; put every command in that one call's `commands` array to save round-trips and avoid dropping the session config.

A bare session (no stealth, no `proxy`) **always** lands on Press & Hold immediately. Stealth lowers the trigger rate; a residential `proxy` lowers it further. Neither solves the CAPTCHA once it has fired.

**One call per location.** Don't reuse one session/call for many locations sequentially — Avis fingerprints session-rate-of-search and starts blocking after ~3 searches even when the first ones succeeded. One call per location, randomize 8–30s of think-time between calls, and issue a fresh call per location to rotate the proxy IP.

### 2. Open the booking page and dismiss modals

Either entry point renders the **same** booking widget — pick by what the agent needs:

| Entry URL                                                                     | Submit button label                                                                                                       | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `https://www.avis.com/en/home`                                                | "Show Vehicles"                                                                                                           | Marketing-led, fewer long-term cues in the page.                                                                                                                                                        |
| `https://www.avis.com/en/products-and-services/services/long-term-car-rental` | "Show Vehicles" (DOM `aria-label` still says "Show cars" — the role string is stale; the visible text is "Show Vehicles") | "Avis Flex" landing — same widget, surfaces the $50/$600 long-term promo and the 15-day minimum / 330-day maximum constraints in copy. **Prefer this URL** so the page context matches the user intent. |

```json
{ "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "https://www.avis.com/en/products-and-services/services/long-term-car-rental", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } },
{ "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 2500 } }        // widget + modals render after 'load'
```

Two modals fire on first visit; both must be dismissed before the form is operable:

1. **Sign-in / best-price promo** (renders ~immediately) — has a real `button: close` ref; safer to dismiss with a `press` Escape (works in iter-1 and iter-2; close-button refs change every navigation, Escape doesn't).
2. **Cookie banner** at viewport bottom (`region: Cookie banner` / `dialog: Privacy`) — does **not** respond to Escape. Click `button: Agree` (or `button: Decline Optional` if the caller prefers to refuse tracking; both unblock the form). Find the ref via the latest snapshot; do not cache it across navigations.

After dismissal:

```json
{ "method": "press", "params": { "key": "Escape" } },            // sign-in modal (real keyboard press)
{ "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 800 } },
{ "method": "snapshot" },                                        // then click whichever cookie button by ref/selector
{ "method": "click", "params": { "selector": "<'Agree' ref/selector from snapshot>" } },
{ "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 800 } }
```

A **third** modal — the email-capture "UP TO 35% OFF / Activate Discount / Continue without discount" — sometimes pops on later navigations (we observed it after the first failed navigation in iter-1). Dismiss with a `press` Escape or by clicking the "Continue without discount" text link.

### 3. Pick-up location: type, wait, **ArrowDown + Enter** (keyboard, never mouse)

```json
{ "method": "snapshot" },                                                                    // resolve 'combobox: Enter pick-up location or delivery address'
{ "method": "click", "params": { "selector": "<pickup combobox>" } },                        // focus the combobox
{ "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 800 } },
{ "method": "type", "params": { "selector": "<pickup combobox>", "text": "LAX" } },          // IATA or city
{ "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 1800 } },                                   // autocomplete renders ~1.5s
{ "method": "press", "params": { "key": "ArrowDown" } },                                      // highlight first suggestion
{ "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 300 } },
{ "method": "press", "params": { "key": "Enter" } },                                          // commit
{ "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 1200 } }                                    // combobox closes, label updates
```

**Critical: use keyboard, not click.** The autocomplete list virtualizes — its DOM refs change every keystroke and clicking the list item by ref fails ~50% of the time with "ref not found" or selects the wrong option. `ArrowDown + Enter` is the only stable commit path. The first non-header suggestion (under the "Airports" or "Cities" sub-heading) is the strongest match — when entering an IATA code like `LAX`, the airport result is always ranked first.

**Confirm before proceeding.** A fresh snapshot's combobox text should now read e.g. "Los Angeles Intl Airport (LAX)" — if it still says "Enter pick-up location or delivery address", the keyboard commit failed; retry from the click step.

After committing the pickup location, Avis **auto-opens the date picker** in the same gesture. Don't fight it — proceed to step 4.

### 4. Dates: navigate the 2-month calendar widget

The date picker is a controlled React widget — a `type` into the underlying `textbox: Select dates` does **not** work (the input is read-only and the widget's controlled state is the source of truth). Use the calendar buttons.

State after step 3 (combobox commit auto-opens the picker):

- Visible months: current + next (e.g. MAY 2026 / JUN 2026 on a May visit).
- Default selection: today + 2 days highlighted as a range ("2 days selected" footer).

To set a range that **spans more than 2 months**, the rhythm is:

```json
// (a) resolve calendar refs, then click the pickup date button
{ "method": "snapshot" },                                                          // find 'button: Monday, June 1st, 2026'
{ "method": "click", "params": { "selector": "<pickup date button>" } },           // sets BOTH pickup + dropoff to that date ("1 day selected" in footer)
{ "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 600 } },

// (b) advance to the dropoff month — repeat this pair ~6× (the next-month chevron ref
//     is stable across re-renders, e.g. 'button: Go to the Next Month')
{ "method": "click", "params": { "selector": "<Go to the Next Month>" } },
{ "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 250 } },                          // short waits between clicks; <200ms drops events

// (c) fresh snapshot, click the dropoff day cell
{ "method": "snapshot" },
{ "method": "click", "params": { "selector": "<'button: Tuesday, December 1st, 2026'>" } },
{ "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 800 } }                           // picker closes, "Dec 01, 2026" appears in form
```

**Picker constraints discovered:**

- Single click on a date when "1 day selected" is shown commits that date as the **dropoff**. The pickup remains the previously clicked date.
- Single click when "2 days selected" is shown **restarts** the range — the click becomes the new pickup, dropoff becomes the same date, footer flips to "1 day selected".
- The calendar advances 1 month per "Next" click and renders BOTH the new month and the month after. No way to jump by year.
- `Esc` while the picker is open closes it without selection — use to bail.

### 5. Times

The pickup-time and dropoff-time controls are `combobox: 12:00 PM` next to each date field. To set non-noon times, use the `select` method on the combobox (the options are 30-min increments from `12:00 AM` to `11:30 PM`). For long-term rentals the time-of-day rarely matters — leaving the 12:00 PM default is fine and avoids an extra click.

### 6. Driver's age

`combobox: Driver's Age` defaults to "Driver's Age: 25+". The other options are "21-24" (triggers an underage surcharge) and "25+". For renters ≥ 25 (the common case for long-term rentals), **leave it untouched** — there is no entry for specific ages like 30 or 35; Avis bands by the surcharge cutoff only. For 21-24, use the `select` method to set the combobox to "21-24" before submitting.

### 7. Submit and brace for the CAPTCHA wall

```json
{ "method": "snapshot" },                                                          // 'button: Show cars' (role label) — visible text reads "Show Vehicles"
{ "method": "click", "params": { "selector": "<Show cars / Show Vehicles submit>" } },
{ "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 5000 } },                         // results page renders progressively
{ "method": "evaluate", "params": { "content": "(()=>location.href)()" } },        // read the URL to branch (7a/7b/7c)
{ "method": "screenshot" }
```

After the click, one of three things happens:

#### 7a. HUMAN Press & Hold CAPTCHA (the wall — most common path)

URL stays on the booking page. Page renders a centered modal "Before we continue… Press & Hold to confirm you are a human (and not a bot)." with a Reference ID like `bd8c3b60-534c-11f1-9e66-3f681c98e7b3`. The Press & Hold button lives in a nested cross-origin iframe (snapshot title: `RootWebArea: Human verification challenge`).

**Cannot be solved with a synthetic drag or dispatched events.** Verified in iter-1: a synthetic press-and-hold drag returns success but does not satisfy the challenge; a CDP-level `Input.dispatchMouseEvent type=mousePressed → wait 2800ms → type=mouseReleased` at the button's viewport center also returns success but does not satisfy it. The same Reference ID remains visible across multiple synthetic press attempts — HUMAN's risk score is gated on pointer-entropy + session-history signals that synthetic events do not produce.

Practical handling:

- **Emit `success: false, reason: "human_press_and_hold", reference_id: "..."`** and abandon this call.
- **Do not retry in the same call/session** — the Reference ID is sticky until the session ends.
- The caller should loop with: end the call → 8–30s think-time → a fresh `browserless_agent` call (stealth + residential `proxy`) → retry. Empirically 40–70% of fresh sessions clear the wall and reach 7b.
- If a HUMAN Press-&-Hold solving path is available (a dedicated `solve` type or an upstream captcha service), route the Reference ID + page URL there — the standard `solve` types (cloudflare/dataDome/recaptcha) do not cover Press & Hold.

#### 7b. Vehicle results page (success path)

URL rewrites to `https://www.avis.com/en/reservation/select-car?...` (observed pattern; results render via Next.js after a brief spinner). A `snapshot` reveals a heading like "Available cars in Los Angeles" plus a stack of vehicle cards under role `region: Vehicle list` (exact role pending — confirm against a clean run). Each card carries:

- Vehicle class header (e.g. "ECONOMY", "INTERMEDIATE SUV", "PREMIUM ELITE SUV") — uppercase paragraph above the car image.
- Vehicle name in title case (e.g. "Nissan Versa or Similar", "Toyota Corolla or Similar") — paragraph below the image.
- Daily price + total price as separate `StaticText` nodes. The card carries two price columns — **pay-later** (default, larger) and **pay-now** (a smaller "Save X%" callout). For long rentals the daily price is a 7- or 30-day average; the **total** is what to compare across locations.
- Fees / taxes link `link: View fee details` opens a per-card breakdown modal. **Do not click** unless the caller specifically asks for the breakdown — each modal opens an XHR and adds ~3s to the per-card extraction.

A `{ "method": "text", "params": { "selector": "body" } }` (or an `evaluate` that parses the cards in-page) returns the rendered text; parse by splitting on the vehicle-class header markers. Take the lowest total across all cards as the cheapest, and emit per-class totals for comparison.

#### 7c. No availability for the requested window

Page renders "No vehicles available for your selected dates and location" header, no cards. Emit `success: true, vehicles: [], sold_out: true`. For 6–12 month windows this is uncommon at large airports but frequent at small-town locations.

### 8. No session release step

There's no release to issue. A `browserless_agent` session persists across calls, keyed by `proxy` — a later call with the same `proxy` reconnects to the same warmed browser (widget state, cookies intact). The per-location flow still lives in one call (§1) to save round-trips and to avoid accidentally dropping the `proxy` config, which would land you in a different, cold session — not because the session dies on return.

### 9. Loop semantics for many locations

- **One call per location.** Do not reuse.
- **Sleep 8–30s between locations**, randomized. Sub-5-second cadences observed escalating CAPTCHA rates.
- **Capture a `screenshot` and the page `html` on every CAPTCHA wall** — that's the debugging surface. Return the `screenshot` block plus an `{ "method": "html", "params": { "selector": "body" } }` per failure and persist them caller-side as `failures/<location>-<ts>.png` / `.html`.
- **Retry policy**: up to 3 fresh-call retries per location before emitting the captcha-wall outcome. If 3/3 land on Press & Hold, give up on that location for this batch.
- **Cap parallelism at 2–3 concurrent sessions**. Higher concurrency from one account accelerates trigger-rate dramatically.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **HUMAN/PerimeterX "Press & Hold" CAPTCHA is the dominant failure mode.** Triggered on Show-Vehicles click. Stealth + a residential `proxy` reduces trigger rate but does not eliminate it. Cannot be solved with synthetic CDP events (verified iter-1); the `solve` command's standard types (cloudflare/dataDome/recaptcha) don't cover Press & Hold. Plan for ~30–60% trigger rate at steady state and treat it as a real outcome shape, not a failure to retry indefinitely.
- **Three separate modals on first visit**, in this order: (1) sign-in best-price-pledge dialog, (2) cookie privacy banner, (3) email-capture "UP TO 35% OFF" modal (intermittent — sometimes triggered after a failed nav). Sign-in modal and email-capture modal accept Escape. Cookie banner does NOT — must click "Agree" or "Decline Optional" by ref.
- **Long-term rentals have a hard 15-day minimum and 330-day maximum.** Documented on the landing page copy. Avis Flex (the long-term product) rejects ranges outside this window — the skill should emit `success: false, reason: "range_outside_15_to_330_days"` for any rangeDays < 15 or > 330 without attempting a search.
- **The booking widget on `/en/home` and `/en/products-and-services/services/long-term-car-rental` is the same widget.** Same DOM IDs (`form#booking-widget-desktop-form`), same fields, same submit handler. Prefer the long-term URL because the page copy frames the search for long-term context and the cheapest-deal narrative.
- **"Show cars" vs "Show Vehicles" label inconsistency.** The submit button's accessibility-tree role string is `button: Show cars` (stale) but its visible text is "Show Vehicles". Match by role + position in the form, not by either label.
- **Autocomplete commit must be keyboard, never click.** The dropdown's DOM refs change every keystroke; clicking a suggestion's snapshot ref races against the next render and fails ~50% of the time. A `press` ArrowDown + `press` Enter is the only stable commit.
- **Typing into the date input does not work.** `textbox: Select dates` is read-only — the widget owns the date state and a `type` is silently ignored. Always navigate via the calendar's day-cell buttons.
- **Date picker auto-opens after location commit.** Don't try to close-then-reopen it — work with what's there. Clicking a date when "1 day selected" is shown commits that as the dropoff; clicking when "2 days selected" is shown **restarts** the range. Get the state model right or you'll set both ends to the same day.
- **The next-month chevron ref is stable across re-renders within one picker session** (observed: `[12-13987]` survived 6 successive clicks in iter-1). The day-cell refs are **not** stable — re-snapshot after every advance.
- **`form action` is a no-op.** The form's HTML `action` attribute echoes the current page URL; submission is JS-only via the React handler. There is no GET-URL deep-link with pickup/dropoff as query params — verified by inspecting the form (`form.method === "get"` but the React component intercepts submit).
- **No documented public API.** `https://www.avis.com/api/*` is gated by the same HUMAN protection — direct POST returns CAPTCHA HTML. Don't waste turns probing for one.
- **`robots.txt` permits the booking flow.** `User-agent: * Allow: /` with `Disallow: /web/*` and a few content paths. The reservation funnel paths are not disallowed. Scraping for read-only price comparison is permitted; respect the rate caveats above.
- **CloudFront is in front; `X-Amz-Cf-Id` headers everywhere.** Page HTML is >1MB, so don't ship it back raw — a `browserless_function` text return caps at ~200k chars and would overflow. Drive full-page navigation with `browserless_agent` and parse in-page with `evaluate`, returning a compact projection. A plain fetch is fine for small resources (`/robots.txt`, `/sitemap.xml`, small JSON).
- **Stealth is on by default for `browserless_agent`.** The stealth/advanced-stealth layer is built in — you don't toggle it; you only add `proxy: { proxy: "residential" }` for the residential-IP layer this site needs.
- **Session-rate triggers Avis fingerprinting.** After ~3 successful searches within ~5 minutes from one session, every subsequent search lands on Press & Hold regardless of stealth. One call per location is the safe pattern.
- **Driver age is banded, not numeric.** Combobox options are "21-24" and "25+" — there is no 30 / 35 / 65+. The skill caller should map any age ≥ 25 to "25+" and pass through. 21-24 surfaces an underage surcharge in the results page; for long-term rentals, the renter is almost always ≥ 25.
- **A raw fetch of Avis HTML is unreliable due to the size cap** — even `https://www.avis.com/en/home` is >1MB, past a `browserless_function`'s ~200k-char return. Drive the page with `browserless_agent` and parse in-page; only fetch known-small resources directly.
