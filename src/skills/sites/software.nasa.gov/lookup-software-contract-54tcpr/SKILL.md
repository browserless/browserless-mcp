      detail page (200=exists, 404=not-found). Preferred over the search API for
      direct ID resolution because the search API does fuzzy prefix matching on

      Only when the JSON endpoint is unreachable. The public search page at
      /search/multi/{center}/software/9/{query} is server-side rendered for the
      first 9 hits but costs ~5× more than the API path and requires extra JS
      execution for pagination.

# NASA Software Catalog Lookup

> **Transport note (Browserless):** This is a public, unauthenticated JSON/HTML API — the HTTP `GET` examples below are canonical; run them from any HTTPS client. Only under restricted egress, route them via `browserless_function`. That runtime is a browser page context (not Node), and a bare `fetch(url)` has no network egress until the page navigates, so first `page.goto('https://software.nasa.gov/')`, then `page.evaluate` a **same-origin** `fetch` of the `/searchapi/...` or `/software/{case}` path and return a compact projection (the text return is capped ~200k chars). No API keys or cookies are involved, so nothing sensitive transits the browser.

## Purpose

Look up software in NASA's public Software Catalog (`software.nasa.gov`) — either by free-text keyword (returning a ranked list of matching titles) or by canonical NASA case number (returning the full record for a single piece of software). For each hit, returns: case number, title, marketing/technical descriptions, NASA field center, category, release type, version, dates, and any external download URL. Read-only; never submits the "Request Software" form.

## When to Use

- "Find NASA software for X" — keyword search across the full agency catalog.
- "Get details on NASA software `LAR-18744-1`" — direct lookup by case number.
- Programmatic monitoring for newly released or revised NASA software.
- Cataloging / filtering by NASA field center (Ames, JPL, Goddard, Langley, etc.) or by software category (aeronautics, propulsion, data and image processing, etc.).
- Anywhere you would otherwise scrape the rendered HTML — the JSON API is faster, structurally richer (24 fields per record vs. 4 in the rendered card), and has no auth, cookies, or anti-bot.

## Workflow

The `software.nasa.gov` front-end is a thin client over a public Elasticsearch-backed JSON endpoint at `/searchapi/multi/{center}/software/{offset}/9/{query}`. No auth, no cookies, no rate-limit headers, no anti-bot Verified — plain HTTPS GET works from any IP. Page size is hard-coded to 9. Lead with the API path; the browser path is a fallback only.

### A. Search by keyword

1. **Get the total result count** (one HTML round-trip — the API itself does not return a count).

   ```
   GET https://software.nasa.gov/search/multi/{center}/software/9/{query}
   ```
   - `{center}` — one of: `aw` (agency-wide / all), `arc` (Ames), `dfrc` (Armstrong), `grc` (Glenn), `gsfc` (Goddard), `jpl` (JPL), `jsc` (Johnson), `ksc` (Kennedy), `larc` (Langley), `msfc` (Marshall), `ssc` (Stennis).
   - `{query}` — URL-encoded keyword(s). Spaces → `%20`. Hyphens allowed.

   Parse total from one of (both present in the HTML):
   - `<div class="searchCount">(\d+) Search Results for "..."</div>`
   - Inline JS literal `let total=<N>;`

2. **Fetch matching records via the JSON API**, paginating by `offset = 0, 9, 18, …` until the API returns `[]` or `offset ≥ total`.

   ```
   GET https://software.nasa.gov/searchapi/multi/{center}/software/{offset}/9/{query}
   ```

   Returns a JSON array of Elasticsearch hits:

   ```json
   [
     {
       "_index": "t2pd.software",
       "_id": "544057a42841f54dacba7027",
       "_score": 1,
       "_source": { /* full software record — see "Expected Output" */ }
     },
     ...
   ]
   ```

   The 24 fields in `_source` (e.g. `case_number`, `marketing_title`, `marketing_desc`, `tech_title`, `sw_desc`, `category`, `center`, `release_type`, `sw_version`, `sw_url`, `release_aisc_date`, `revision_date`) are the canonical record and are richer than the rendered card or the public detail page — you usually do not need step 3.

3. **(Optional) Fetch the public detail page** for a single hit if you need the rendered "Contact Us" email, the FAQ-formatted release-type explainer, or a visual screenshot:
   ```
   GET https://software.nasa.gov/software/{case_number}
   ```
   Returns server-rendered HTML; the `<h1>` is `{marketing_title}({case_number})` and labeled rows under "Software Details" carry Category, Reference Number, Release Type, and Operating System. **The detail page is strictly a subset of the JSON record — there is no information here the API does not already have.**

### B. Direct lookup by case number

If the user already knows the canonical case number (e.g. `LAR-18744-1`, `NPO-50498-1`, `GSC-15016-1`), do **not** use the search API — it does a fuzzy multi-field match on the case-number string and returns center-prefix-mates ranked above the exact match (e.g. searching `LAR-18744-1` returns `LAR-19278-1` as the top hit, not the exact match). Instead:

1. **Hit the detail URL directly**:

   ```
   GET https://software.nasa.gov/software/{case_number}
   ```
   - HTTP `200` with `<h1>...({case_number})</h1>` → exists. Parse `<h1>` and the "Software Details" rows for category, release type, etc.
   - HTTP `404` → unknown case number.

2. **(Optional) Backfill the rich JSON record** by extracting the marketing title from the `<h1>` and querying the search API with that title — the exact-title query lands the canonical record as hit #1 with all 24 `_source` fields.

### C. Autocomplete (optional)

For "did you mean" suggestions on a partial query (≥ 4 chars), call:

```
GET https://software.nasa.gov/searchsuggestions/{partial}
```

Returns `{"success": true, "data": ["trajectory", "trajectory optimization", ...]}` (up to 10 strings) or `[]` if no matches. Useful for query expansion before the main search call. Returns `[]` for queries shorter than 3-4 characters.

### Browser fallback

Use only when the JSON endpoint is unreachable (sanctions, network policy, or — extremely rare — the Drupal cache is misbehaving). Drive it with `browserless_agent`: `goto` the public search page `https://software.nasa.gov/search/multi/{center}/software/9/{query}`, then read the markup with a `text` command on `body` (or an `evaluate` that parses in-page). The page is fully server-side rendered for the first 9 hits (Drupal Views) — no JS execution required to read them. Extract:

- **Per-result `<div class="result">` block**, each containing:
  - Case number: `<a href="https://software.nasa.gov/software/([A-Z0-9\-]+)">` (also the anchor text)
  - Title: `<div class="title">([^<]+)</div>` (the `marketing_title`)
  - Description: `<div class="description">([^<]+)</div>` (the `marketing_desc`, truncated)
  - Release type: `<div class="category">([^<]+)</div>` (re-uses the `category` class but carries the `release_type` text — confusingly named)
- **Total count**: `<div class="searchCount">(\d+) Search Results` (also `let total=<N>;` in the in-page JS).
- **Pagination via browser** means issuing an `evaluate` command that runs `document.querySelector(".viewMore").click()` per +9 batch, waiting for the new cards to render, then re-reading the DOM — much more expensive than just hitting the JSON endpoint at the next offset. Skip the browser entirely once you have the count.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **The "obvious" search-API URL is a trap.** The view-more JS embedded in the search page advertises `/searchapi/software/{query}/software/{page}/9/` — that endpoint **always returns `[]`** for every query, every offset, every center (confirmed across multiple iterations 2026-05-18). The actually-working endpoint is **`/searchapi/multi/{center}/software/{offset}/9/{query}`** — note the segment order: `{offset}/9/{query}` is correct, **not** `{offset}/{query}` (the trailing `/9/` is the page size and **must** be present — without it the query parameter is silently ignored and you get the unfiltered agency-wide pager). This was the highest-cost discovery during scaffolding; the URL inside the page's JS is stale.
- **Query parameter is silently dropped if path shape is wrong.** Any malformed variant of the path (missing `/9/`, wrong segment order, using `aw` in the query slot, etc.) returns the **unfiltered top-9 of the catalog** with HTTP 200 — there is no error signal. Always verify by submitting a query you know is unique (e.g. `TPSSizer`) and confirming the response shape matches expectations (hit count should be small for unique terms).
- **No total-count in the JSON.** The API only returns the slice of 9; the total is published in the rendered HTML page (`class="searchCount"` and inline `let total=<N>;`). Either fetch the HTML once at offset=0 to grab the count, or paginate blindly until you get `[]`.
- **Page size is hard-coded to 9.** The `/9/` in the path is the size and is not overridable — `/10/`, `/100/`, etc. all return `{}` (empty object, not an array) or `[]`. Plan pagination in increments of 9.
- **Empty / very-short queries silently return browse-all-9.** `q=""`, `q=" "`, `q="x"` all return 9 results sorted by the catalog's default order (ARC entries first), **not** an error. Validate the query is ≥ 2 characters before issuing the request and treat short-query responses as "browse" rather than "search-result".
- **Direct case-number lookup via the search API is unreliable.** Querying `case_number` strings does a fuzzy match on the prefix and ranks center-prefix-mates above the exact case (e.g. `LAR-18744-1` returns `LAR-19278-1` as hit #1). For exact-id lookup, fetch `https://software.nasa.gov/software/{case_number}` directly (HTTP 200 = exists, 404 = unknown).
- **The `category` field on result cards is actually `release_type`.** In the rendered HTML (`<div class="category">`) the value is the release-type enum (`Open Source`, `General Public Release`, `U.S. Release Only`, `U.S. and Foreign Release`, `U.S. Government Purpose Release`), **not** the technical category. The actual technical category lives in `_source.category` (lowercase) / `_source.sw_category` (title-case display). Don't conflate them.
- **Field-center enum is closed.** Valid `{center}` values: `aw, arc, dfrc, grc, gsfc, jpl, jsc, ksc, larc, msfc, ssc`. Unknown values return `[]`. JPL's `_source.center` is `JPL` even though its case-numbers are `NPO-*` (legacy Jet Propulsion lab "Naval Propellant Office" prefix), not `JPL-*`. Don't try to infer center from case-number prefix.
- **Category-browse pages are not server-rendered.** `https://software.nasa.gov/software/category/{slug}/{center}/{page}/` returns an empty results div — these pages depend on JS to fetch and render their hits. **There is no public JSON endpoint for category-browse** (only the keyword `/searchapi/multi/.../{query}` endpoint, which does not accept a category filter). If you need category-scoped results, either: (a) call the keyword API with the category slug as the query (e.g. `q=propulsion`) — produces approximate results, or (b) call the keyword API for every term you care about and filter client-side on `_source.category`.
- **Latency / rate-limiting.** Median response ~1.6-1.8s per API call from a US-West vantage point. No rate-limit headers and no formal block observed at 3 req/s; keep ≤ 2 req/s sustained to be polite.
- **CDN cache is aggressive.** `X-Drupal-Cache: HIT` on most responses; `Cache-Control: must-revalidate, no-cache, private` is ignored by the CloudFront layer in practice. Newly-added software entries may take up to a few minutes to appear. The `revision_date` field in `_source` is the canonical "last modified" timestamp.
- **`sw_url` is sparsely populated.** Open-source codes typically have a non-empty `sw_url` pointing to a GitHub/SourceForge/lab page; export-controlled codes (`U.S. Release Only`, `U.S. Government Purpose Release`) leave it blank and require the "Request Software" form (which this skill does not exercise).
- **`sw_version_date: "1970-01-01T08:00:00.000Z"` is a sentinel for "no version date".** Treat as null. (The 8:00 offset is PST epoch-zero — a Drupal default.)
- **Browser CDP path not always reachable.** `browserless_function` and `browserless_agent` reach the JSON/HTML API over plain HTTPS (the `function` runtime navigates same-origin, then fetches) — which is all this skill needs. The full browser/CDP session path may be restricted in some hardened runtime environments, so automated screenshots may not be available depending on your sandbox. This is fine for this skill since the JSON API path needs only HTTPS GETs.
