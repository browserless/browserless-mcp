# GasBuddy Find Cheapest Gas

## Purpose

Given a US ZIP code (or "City, ST" text), return the cheapest gas stations near that location from GasBuddy — including each station's name, brand, full street address, fuel grade searched, current price per gallon (cash or credit), the reporter who submitted that price, how recently it was reported, and an optional straight-line distance from the ZIP centroid. Read-only — never reports a price, never logs in, never books anything.

## When to Use

- A consumer-shopping agent needs to surface the 1-20 cheapest stations near a given ZIP for a specific fuel grade (Regular / Midgrade / Premium / Diesel).
- A trip-planning agent needs station-level prices ranked by cost (not by proximity).
- A market-research workflow scanning prices across multiple cities daily — `/home?search=<query>` is the single canonical entry point.
- Use `restaurants/opentable-check-availability` style branching — multiple distinct outcome shapes are returned (success-N, success-one, no-stations-for-zip, ambiguous-text-search). See **Expected Output** below.

## Workflow

GasBuddy's `/home?search=<query>&fuel=<N>` page server-renders a ranked list of cheapest stations as `GenericStationListItem` cards. The list size is **search-term-shape dependent** (this is the most important gotcha — see Site-Specific Gotchas):

- A **ZIP code** → tight proximity search → typically **0-2** stations (just the very cheapest in walking distance from the ZIP centroid). Often **zero** results for dense urban Manhattan / downtown Chicago ZIPs, where the nearest station is outside the radius.
- A **"City, ST"** text → city-wide search → up to **20** stations server-rendered in one page.
- A **canonical city slug page** (`/gasprices/<state-slug>/<city-slug>`) → up to **10** stations + an asynchronous `StationPrices` GraphQL hydration for current prices.

The recommended flow is browser-driven because the page is a fully client-rendered Next.js SPA behind Cloudflare; a raw HTML fetch returns the shell but skips the post-hydration price refresh. Lead with a `browserless_agent` call using a **residential proxy** (`proxy: { proxy: "residential" }`); advanced stealth is **not** required during validation.

### 1. Use a residential-proxy session

The session is keyed by `proxy`/`profile` — set
`proxy: { proxy: "residential" }` at the top level of **every** call so each call
reconnects to the same session (dropping or changing it lands you in a different,
blank session). There is no session to create or export:

```json
{ "proxy": { "proxy": "residential" }, "commands": [/* goto + waits + read */] }
```

Stealth was tested and is unnecessary — a residential proxy alone returned 200s on every request across multiple ZIPs.

### 2. Search by ZIP first

`fuel` is `1`=Regular, `2`=Midgrade, `3`=Premium, `4`=Diesel. Navigate to
`https://www.gasbuddy.com/home?search=<ZIP>&fuel=<FUEL>`, wait out the
post-hydration price refresh, then read the fully rendered HTML — all in one call:

```json
{
  "proxy": { "proxy": "residential" },
  "commands": [
    {
      "method": "goto",
      "params": {
        "url": "https://www.gasbuddy.com/home?search=75201&fuel=1",
        "waitUntil": "load",
        "timeout": 45000
      }
    },
    { "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 4000 } },
    { "method": "html", "params": { "selector": "body" } }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Parse `GenericStationListItem` cards

Split the HTML on the regex `class="[^"]*GenericStationListItem-module__station[^"]*"\s+id="(\d+)"` — each match anchors one station card. Within each card chunk:

| Field           | Selector (regex)                                                                                                   | Notes                                                                                                                                             |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `station_id`    | `id="(\d+)"` on the card div                                                                                       | Internal GasBuddy ID; used in `/station/{id}` URL                                                                                                 |
| `brand`         | `<img alt="([^"]+)" class="image__image[^"]*"` (first match in chunk)                                              | "Shell", "76", "Costco", "DataFeed"-stations show generic-pump icon with no alt                                                                   |
| `name`          | inside `StationDisplay-module__stationNameHeader`, `<a href="/station/\d+"[^>]*>([^<]+)</a>`                       | Usually equals brand; sometimes a specific franchise name                                                                                         |
| `address`       | `<div class="StationDisplay-module__address[^"]*">(.*?)</div>` with `<br>` separator                               | Line 1 = street, Line 2 = "City, ST"                                                                                                              |

| `price`         | `<span class="[^"]*StationDisplayPrice-module__price[^"]*">([^<]+)</span>`                                         | Format `$X.XX` or `- - -` when stale                                                                                                              |
| `reporter`      | `class="[^"]*ReportedBy-module__memberLink[^"]*"\s+href="(/member/[^"]+)"[^>]*>(?:<img[^>]*>)?(?:&nbsp;)?([^<]+)<` | Captures both `/member/<username>` URL and display name. Special reporter `DataFeed` (`/member/datafeed`) = automated price feed, not a real user |

### 4. Branch on result count

After parsing:

- **2+ stations** → emit `outcome: "stations_for_zip"` with the parsed list.
- **1 station** → emit `outcome: "single_cheapest_for_zip"` (this is the dominant ZIP-search shape — `/home?search=ZIP` is a tight-radius query and most ZIPs surface exactly the local cheapest).
- **0 stations + visible "No stations found. Try refining your search."** → fall through to step 5. **Do not** emit success-with-zero — the search was too narrow, not actually empty.

The page also renders a `<state> Gas Price Stats` panel with `$X.XX Lowest` and `$Y.YY Average` regardless of station list — extract these as `state_lowest_usd` and `state_average_usd` in every response (they're always present and confirm which US state the ZIP geocoded to).

### 5. Fall back: widen to "City, ST" search

When ZIP-based search returns 0 stations:

1. Read the state name from the stats panel header — regex `>(\w[\w ]+?) Gas Price Stats<` → e.g. `"New York"`, `"Illinois"`.
2. Resolve ZIP → city. GasBuddy itself does not provide a public ZIP→city lookup on this surface; use either: (a) a local `pyzipcode`/`uszipcode` library, (b) an external geocoding service, or (c) a precomputed table of major-metro ZIPs. The skill caller is expected to provide this — see the `city_hint` input field in the example output schema.
3. Re-issue `/home?search=<URL-encoded "City, ST">&fuel=N` and re-parse. This returns up to **20** stations.

Alternatively — if all that's available is the state — navigate to the canonical state directory `https://www.gasbuddy.com/gasprices/<state-slug>` (slug = state name lowercased, spaces → hyphens: `"new-hampshire"`, `"washington-dc"`) and pick a metro from there. The dollar-amount Stats panel on `/home?search=ZIP` also gives a state-wide lowest/average usable as a coarse fallback signal.

### 6. (Optional) Compute distance from ZIP centroid

The web UI **does not display distance**. To populate the `distance_mi` field:

1. After the first navigation, read the **VIEW MAP** link's `href` via `evaluate` (or `click` it) — it points at `/gaspricemap?fuel=1&z=13&lat=<LAT>&lng=<LNG>` where `LAT/LNG` is the geocoded ZIP centroid. Capture those two query params _before_ navigating to the map (reading the link's `href` is enough).
2. Each station's `latitude` / `longitude` is in `window.__APOLLO_STATE__` under `Station:<id>` entries — read via `{ "method": "evaluate", "params": { "content": "JSON.stringify(window.__APOLLO_STATE__)" } }` and locate by station ID.
3. Compute haversine distance in miles between ZIP and station coordinates.

Distance is **post-processed** — GasBuddy does not return it in the rendered HTML.

### 7. Session lifecycle

No session-release step (nothing to release). The session persists across separate
calls, keyed by `proxy`/`profile`, so a later call carrying the same config
reconnects to the same page with cookies and hydration state intact. Batching the
whole ZIP → fallback → map flow inside one call's `commands` array saves round-trips
and avoids accidentally dropping that config.

### Hybrid alternative: direct GraphQL (advanced, fragile)

The page issues `POST https://www.gasbuddy.com/graphql` with `operationName: "StationPrices"` and variables `{ area, countryCode, criteria: { location_type: ["locality","metro"] }, fuel, regionCode }` to hydrate prices for a city slug. Headers required: `content-type: application/json`, `apollo-require-preflight: true`, `gbcsrf: <token>` (from a `gbcsrf` cookie set on first page load). The response carries `cash` / `credit` `{ nickname, postedTime (ISO 8601), price, formattedPrice }` per station — structurally cleaner than HTML parsing.

**Do not lead with this** — it requires (a) bootstrapping a cookie jar from a real GET to set `gbcsrf`, (b) prior knowledge of the canonical city slug and state code (no ZIP-based variant of this operation has been observed), and (c) the operation set rotates with frontend deploys. The browser path tolerates all of that automatically. The GraphQL POST is documented here as a `hybrid` accelerator for repeated queries against the same city slug where reducing per-request latency is worth the cookie-management complexity.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **ZIP-based search is a tight-radius proximity query, not a city search.** `/home?search=10001&fuel=1` (Manhattan) returns the literal "No stations found. Try refining your search." text — **0 stations** — because the nearest reported station is outside the radius GasBuddy uses for ZIP queries. The page still renders a "<State> Gas Price Stats" panel, which tricks naïve parsers into thinking the search worked. Verified on `10001` (Manhattan) and `60601` (downtown Chicago) — both returned 0 stations despite having dozens of stations within 2 miles. The same query with `?search=Chicago%2C+IL` returned 20 stations.
- **Same surface, two different result-size ceilings.** `/home?search=` is the only URL pattern that returns up to **20** stations server-rendered in one HTML response; the canonical city page `/gasprices/<state>/<city>` is capped at **10**. If you want a long list, use `/home?search=City%2C+ST`, not the city page.
- **No native distance field.** GasBuddy's web UI never displays distance from the search point. Distance must be computed client-side from station `latitude`/`longitude` (available in `window.__APOLLO_STATE__` under `Station:<id>`) and the ZIP centroid (parsable from the `VIEW MAP` link's `lat=` / `lng=` URL params). Honesty rule: if you can't get both coordinates, emit `distance_mi: null` rather than guessing.
- **`DataFeed` reporter is an automated price feed, not a person.** Stations with `reporter: "DataFeed"` (linking to `/member/datafeed`) are price-fed from POS systems or third-party data partners, not crowd-reported by a user. Surface this in the output as `reporter_type: "automated"` so downstream callers can distinguish freshness sources — `DataFeed` prices tend to be more recent than crowd reports.
- **Stale prices render as `- - -`, not `$0.00` or null.** Stations with no recent report show `<span>- - -</span>` in the price slot and have no `ReportedBy` block. Treat as `price: null, reported_age: null` rather than dropping the row — the address + brand are still useful metadata.
- **`fuel` is a 1-indexed enum, not a fuel-product string.** URL param `fuel=1` Regular, `fuel=2` Midgrade, `fuel=3` Premium, `fuel=4` Diesel. The GraphQL `prices(fuel: N)` argument uses the same integer mapping. Omit `fuel` from the URL and GasBuddy defaults to Regular (`fuel=1`); other absent values are not silently substituted.
- **`?maxAge=0` is "no max age" (i.e. show all reports including ancient ones), NOT "must be 0 minutes old".** This is the inverse of what the URL implies. Set `maxAge` to a positive integer (minutes) only if you want to filter out stale reports. Default is unset (no filter).
- **The form's `FIND GAS` button is decorative when the URL already has `?search=`.** A `click` on the FIND GAS button just re-canonicalizes the URL params (alphabetizes them) and re-runs the same search — no new state. Don't waste a turn clicking it; the URL param is the single source of truth.
- **`/gas-prices/<ST>/<ZIP>` (with hyphen) issues a 308 redirect to the lowercase variant `/gas-prices/<st>/<zip>`, which then 404s.** This URL pattern is not a working ZIP-page surface. Don't waste time on it. The working ZIP entry is `/home?search=<ZIP>`.
- **Canonical city slug pattern is `/gasprices/<state-slug>/<city-slug>` (no hyphen in `gasprices`).** Cousin pattern `/gas-prices/<state>/<city>` (with hyphen) 404s. Slug rules: lowercase, spaces → hyphens, no diacritics. `washington-dc`, `new-hampshire`, `puerto-rico`, `beverly-hills`.
- **The `/gaspricemap` page is a heatmap, not a station list.** Clicking `VIEW MAP` from a search result navigates to `/gaspricemap?fuel=N&z=13&lat=X&lng=Y` which renders an interactive Mapbox-style heatmap with no per-station list in the DOM. Useful only to extract the ZIP centroid `(lat, lng)` from the URL — not for harvesting stations.
- **Cloudflare protects the site, but a residential proxy alone is sufficient.** `proxy: { proxy: "residential" }` was tested across 4 distinct ZIPs (90210, 10001, 60601, 75201) and got `200 OK` on every page load. Stealth was **not** required. If a future run gets blocked, adding a stealth/verified mode is the first escalation.
- **Apollo state (`window.__APOLLO_STATE__`) is server-rendered with addresses + lat/lon but NOT prices.** Don't expect to grab prices straight from the Apollo blob — they arrive in a later `StationPrices` GraphQL POST. The rendered HTML after a ~4s `waitForTimeout` is the only reliable source of fresh price + reporter + age data.
- **GraphQL POST requires `gbcsrf` header from cookie.** A bare `curl` to `https://www.gasbuddy.com/graphql` returns `400 Bad request` with no payload. The `gbcsrf` token is set as a same-site cookie by the first GET to any `gasbuddy.com` page. Browser path picks this up for free; direct API path requires bootstrapping a cookie jar first.
- **Cookie banner overlays the bottom 60-90px of every page.** Doesn't block extraction (the underlying DOM is rendered) but truncates screenshots. Clicking "Reject All" before screenshotting is optional; the data extraction works regardless.

Field rules:

- `fuel_grade` values: `"regular"`, `"midgrade"`, `"premium"`, `"diesel"` — derived from the `fuel` URL param (1→4).
- `price_usd` is the numeric value; `price_display` preserves the rendered string (`"$4.19"` or `"- - -"`).
- `reporter_type` is `"automated"` when `reporter == "DataFeed"`, else `"crowd"`.
- `reported_age` preserves the human string verbatim. Callers who want absolute timestamps should subtract from `Date.now()` at parse time.
- `distance_mi` is `null` unless step 6 of the workflow was executed (lat/lon-based haversine from ZIP centroid).
- `latitude` / `longitude` per station are only populated if `window.__APOLLO_STATE__` was harvested (an `evaluate`); they are `null` if only the HTML was scraped.
