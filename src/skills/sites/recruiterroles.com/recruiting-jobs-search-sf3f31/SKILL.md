  Search recruiter and talent-acquisition jobs on recruiterroles.com with
  filters for location (city, state, country, remote), salary floor, employment
  type (full-time, contract, freelance, part-time), work arrangement, and
  sector. Prefers the free public REST API; falls back to slug-based browser
  navigation when no API key is available.

  - method: url-param
    rationale: >-
      Public web pages support filtering by slug path only (one dimension at a
      time — sector, role-type, city, or country). No-auth and zero-cost; use
      when no API key is available and only a single filter dimension is needed.
      Salary filtering is not available on this surface.
  - method: browser
    rationale: >-
      Full browser fallback for cases where the slug URLs are blocked or you
      need to extract listings interactively. Plain browserless_agent works —
      no proxy arg needed, the site has no anti-bot. Salary filtering via the
      in-page Filters popover is brittle (state does not sync to URL), so even
      the browser fallback should call the API for salary-floored queries.

# Recruiter Roles — Search Recruiter / Talent Acquisition Jobs

## Purpose

Given a recruiter-job search (any combination of location, salary floor, employment type, work arrangement, sector, or free-text query), return a list of matching job postings from [recruiterroles.com](https://recruiterroles.com) — title, company, location, employment type, work arrangement, sector, disclosed salary band, posting date, and canonical URL. Read-only; never posts, applies, or signs up.

Recruiter Roles is a job board for jobs **for** recruiters and talent-acquisition professionals (agency recruiters, in-house TA, executive search associates, etc.), not for jobs _posted by_ recruiters. Catalog size ~1,300 active listings (2026-05).

## When to Use

- "Show me remote technical-recruiter jobs paying ≥ $90k."
- "What in-house TA roles are open in NYC right now?"
- "List every agency recruiter opening at Robert Half / Michael Page / Kelly."
- Daily incremental sync of new recruiter jobs by sector or company.
- Anywhere you'd otherwise scrape an aggregated recruiter-job listing — the public REST API is faster, free, and structurally complete.

## Workflow

Recruiter Roles ships a free, documented public REST API at `https://recruiterroles.com/api/v1` that supports every filter the user-facing site exposes and several it doesn't (salary floor, posted-since, updated-since, source-type, custom sort). The site is on Vercel/Next.js + Supabase with **no anti-bot stealth required** (no Akamai, no Cloudflare challenge, no captcha) — but unauthenticated `/api/v1/*` requests return `401 unauthorized`. A residential proxy is **not** required for either the API or the browser fallback.

**Three usable surfaces, in preference order:**

| Surface               | Auth                             | Filtering                                                                                                                                                | Cost                  | Use when                                                 |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET /api/v1/jobs`    | Bearer key (free, instant issue) | Full — q, sector, state, city, employment_type, work_arrangement, is_remote, salary_min, salary_disclosed, posted_since, updated_since, sort, pagination | 1,000 req/day per key | Every real query, especially salary-filtered             |
| Slug URL pages        | None                             | Sector / role-type / city / country only (no salary, no free-text)                                                                                       | None                  | One-off browsing, no key available, ≤ 1 filter dimension |
| `GET /feed.xml` (RSS) | None                             | None — recent-postings firehose                                                                                                                          | None                  | Polling for newest jobs regardless of filter             |

### 1. Recommended path — JSON API at `/api/v1/jobs`

**1a. Get a key (one-time, free, instant).** Either:

- The user already has one (format: `rr_live_<32-char>`), or
- POST the registration form at `https://recruiterroles.com/api-access` (name, email, website URL, use-case, backlink checkbox). The raw key is shown **once** at issuance — store it securely. Re-issuance requires contacting the operator.

**1b. Call `/api/v1/jobs` with filter params.**

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer rr_live_YOUR_KEY" \
  "https://recruiterroles.com/api/v1/jobs?\
sector=technology&\
state=CA&\
city=san-francisco-ca&\
work_arrangement=remote&\
employment_type=full_time&\
salary_min=90000&\
salary_disclosed=true&\
sort=salary_desc&\
per_page=50&\
page=1"
```

**Unrecognized params are silently ignored** — verify each param made it into the filter by inspecting `meta.total` against expectations.

**1c. Parse the response.** Each `data[i]` is a fully-decoded job object — no positional arrays, no lookup tables. Salary band is in `salary.min_dollars` / `salary.max_dollars` (nulls when `salary.disclosed === false`). `url` is a tracked redirect with your `ref_code` auto-appended for UTM attribution; `canonical_url` is the direct page; `apply_url` is the employer's external apply link (not tracked).

**1d. Paginate via `meta.next_page`** until null. With `per_page=100` a 1,300-job full-catalog sync is 13 requests.

**1e. Honor rate limits.** 1,000 requests/day per key, resets midnight UTC. Headers `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `X-RateLimit-Reset` (epoch). 429 returns `Retry-After`.

**1f. Backlink obligation.** If displaying API data to end users, include a visible link back: `<a href="https://recruiterroles.com">Recruiter Roles</a>`. Keys may be suspended otherwise.

### 2. Slug fallback (no API key needed)

When no API key is available, the public web pages support filtering by **slug path** but **not** by query string. Available slugs:

| Dimension       | Slug pattern                                                                                                                                                          | Examples                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Only **one slug dimension at a time** (the URL path is a single slug). Combining e.g. "remote AND technology" or "SF AND salary ≥ $90k" requires the API or client-side filtering after fetch.

```jsonc
// Open slug page, paginate with ?page=N (the ONLY query param honored by web pages).
// One browserless_agent call, no proxy arg:
{ "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "https://recruiterroles.com/technology?page=1", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } }
{ "method": "snapshot" }
```

Extract listings from the accessibility snapshot — each one is a `link:` node directly under the `list: Job listings` container. The aria-label baked into the link follows a stable shape:

```
{company} logo {title} {posted_age} {company} {location} [{salary band} ] {sector} {employment_type} [Remote] [Agency|In-House]
```

Pull the canonical URL from `urlMap` keyed by the listing's snapshot ref (`{slug}` → `https://recruiterroles.com/jobs/{slug}`). Page total is at the top: `heading: {Section Title}` then `StaticText: {N,NNN} jobs`. The "out of N" paginator at the bottom confirms the filtered total.

### 3. RSS feed (no key, no filter)

`GET https://recruiterroles.com/feed.xml` — `application/rss+xml`, no auth, no filter parameters. Returns the most recent jobs as standard RSS `<item>` entries with `<title>`, `<link>` (canonical job URL), `<pubDate>`, `<description>` (HTML excerpt), and `<category>` (location string). Useful as a polling firehose; filter client-side. The feed does **not** support cursor/since semantics — re-fetch and dedupe by `<guid>`.

### Browser fallback (when both API and slug paths are blocked)

A full browser session also works — plain `browserless_agent`, no proxy arg needed. Open `/recruiter-jobs[/{slug}][?page=N]`, snapshot, extract listings as above. The on-page **Filters button** opens an interactive popover for salary range and other refinements — but those settings do **not** sync to the URL, so they're hard to reproduce headlessly and brittle to UI changes. **Prefer the API for salary-filtered queries.**

Run it as ONE `browserless_agent` call with an ordered `commands` array — no session create/release step, since the session persists across calls (keyed by `proxy`/`profile`) with nothing to explicitly tear down:

```jsonc
{ "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "https://recruiterroles.com/technology", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } }
{ "method": "snapshot" }   // parse list: "Job listings" container
```

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **`/api/v1/*` returns 401 without an `Authorization: Bearer rr_live_…` header**, even for the otherwise-public `/sectors`, `/locations`, `/stats` endpoints. The only no-key surfaces are `/feed.xml` and the rendered HTML slug pages.
- **`/recruiter-jobs?q=foo&city=bar` URL query params on the web page are silently ignored** (apart from `?page=N`). Typing into the search/location textboxes updates the URL with `?q=…&location=…` and pre-fills the input, but the displayed listings — and the "N jobs" total at top of the page — do **not** refilter on direct navigation to that URL or on Enter. Verified 2026-05-19: navigating fresh to `/recruiter-jobs?q=technical+recruiter` still showed "1,307 jobs" (the unfiltered total) with the unfiltered listing set. To filter the public web page, use **slug paths only** (or the API).
- **Public web pages support exactly one slug filter dimension at a time.** There is no URL grammar for compound web filters like "remote AND technology AND san-francisco". For compound filters, use the API.
- **Salary filtering is API-only on the public surfaces.** The web UI's "Filters" button opens a client-side popover (snapshot reveals no URL sync) — its state does not survive navigation and cannot be reproduced reliably from the URL layer. Use `salary_min` and `salary_disclosed` on `/api/v1/jobs`.
- **`salary_min` excludes undisclosed-salary jobs.** A large fraction of postings on the catalog do not disclose salary (`salary.disclosed: false`, both min/max null) — setting `salary_min` removes them entirely. To preserve them, omit `salary_min` and filter client-side, or call twice (with and without `salary_min`) and merge.
- **Salary currency is normalized to USD for the `salary_min` filter** but the response preserves the per-job `salary.currency`. Watch for non-USD bands in the output — e.g. one observed listing showed `SGD 45,000 / yr` rendered on a US-region job (Chicago, IL); that is the employer's declared currency, not a UI bug.
- **`employment_type` is API-only.** All slug-based "type" filters (`/contract`, `/full-time`, `/remote`) are actually a **work arrangement** mix: `/remote` returns jobs with `work_arrangement=remote`; `/contract` returns `employment_type=contract`; `/full-time` returns `employment_type=full_time`. They cannot be combined.
- **`work_arrangement=hybrid` returns 0 results in the current catalog** (`/api/v1/stats` confirmed `by_work_arrangement: { on_site: 606, hybrid: 0, remote: 105 }` on 2026-05-19). Don't treat hybrid as a fall-back for "remote-friendly" — it's an honest empty set. The same stats endpoint is the source of truth for what's currently bookable.
- **Two URL fields per job — pick the right one.** `url` is a tracked redirect (`/go/{slug}?ref=…`) that appends UTM params and registers a click. `canonical_url` is the direct `/jobs/{slug}` page. `apply_url` is the employer's external job-board URL (Workday, Paylocity, etc.) and is **not** tracked. Use `canonical_url` for display / linking, `url` only when you want to deliver real click attribution back to Recruiter Roles, and `apply_url` only as a downstream apply target.
- **Rate-limit is per-key per-UTC-day, not per-IP.** Sharing a key across services hits the 1,000/day ceiling collectively. Check `X-RateLimit-Remaining` per response; a 429 carries `Retry-After`.
- **Free key requires a backlink display.** If you render API data to end users, include a visible `<a href="https://recruiterroles.com">Recruiter Roles</a>`. Keys are suspended for hidden / cloaked backlinks (verified policy at `/api-docs`).
- **API is read-only (GET only).** Any other verb returns `405 method_not_allowed`. There is no agent-callable application endpoint — the `apply_url` external link is the only application surface.
- **Sector / city / state slugs are slugs, not display names.** `Healthcare & Life Sciences` is `healthcare-life-sciences`; `San Francisco, CA` is `san-francisco-ca`; `British Columbia` is `BC`. The authoritative enums are at `/api/v1/sectors`, `/api/v1/locations?level=countries|regions|cities`, and a key is required to query them.
- **`/feed.xml` has no since/cursor semantics.** Polling it re-streams the same recent items each call; dedupe by `<guid>` (which is the canonical job URL).
- **`/api/v1/` (with trailing slash) 308-redirects to `/api/v1` (without).** Some HTTP clients break on the redirect — strip the trailing slash up front.
- **No anti-bot, no captcha, no stealth needed.** A plain curl (or any HTTP client) works for both API and slug pages from any IP; under restricted egress, route it through `browserless_function` instead. No proxy arg is needed on `browserless_agent` for the browser fallback either — it only adds latency.

## Expected Output

The skill's output shape mirrors `GET /api/v1/jobs` directly when the API path is used. When the slug-fallback path is used, populate the same shape from the scraped a11y snapshot — leaving `salary.*` null for undisclosed jobs and copying location text verbatim.
