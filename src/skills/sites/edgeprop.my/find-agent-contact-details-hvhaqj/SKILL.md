# EdgeProp.my Find Agent Contact Details

## Purpose

Given an EdgeProp.my agent profile URL (`/agent/{id}/{slug}`) or any listing URL (`/listing/sale/{id}/...` or `/listing/rent/{id}/...`), return the listing agent's full display name, full unmasked mobile phone number (E.164 normalized for Malaysia), and email address. Read-only — never submits the Send Enquiry form, never books or contacts the agent.

## When to Use

- Looking up the contact details of a specific listed real-estate agent on EdgeProp Malaysia.
- Building a contact card for any Malaysian property listing (sale or rental) — pulls the agent off the listing without the user needing to know the agent's own URL.
- Bulk enrichment of agents discovered via `/agents` directory pages or via Browserbase Search results pointing at `edgeprop.my/agent/...`.
- Anywhere you'd otherwise scrape the rendered UI and chase the "Show Number" click-to-reveal — the JSON payload embedded in the page exposes the full phone _and_ email upfront, so the click is wasted work.

## Workflow

EdgeProp.my is a Next.js application sitting behind Cloudflare's managed-challenge bot protection. The page UI masks the agent's phone as `01X XXX XXXX` and only offers an enquiry-form gateway for email — **but the `<script id="__NEXT_DATA__">` payload that Next.js inlines on every server-rendered page contains the agent's raw, unmasked phone and email in plaintext**. Fetch the page once with a real Chromium that can pass the Cloudflare challenge, parse `__NEXT_DATA__`, done. No clicks, no enquiry form, no waiting on XHR reveals.

Cloudflare blocks plain `curl` / `wget` / non-residential HTTP with a 403 + JS challenge — confirmed during iteration. You **must** use a stealth browser session on residential proxies (`browserless_agent` with `proxy: { proxy: "residential" }`) and let the page sit for ~10–15s after first navigation for the CF challenge to clear. After that the page is unchanged from a normal browser session. One ephemeral `browserless_agent` call carries the whole flow (navigate → wait → extract) in its `commands` array, so cookies persist across the steps:

```jsonc
// browserless_agent, proxy: { proxy: "residential" }
[
  // 1. Navigate to the target — an agent profile (/agent/{id}/{slug}) or any
  //    listing (/listing/sale/..., /listing/rent/..., /rental/...).
  {
    "method": "goto",
    "params": {
      "url": "https://www.edgeprop.my/agent/103203/eleen-ooi",
      "waitUntil": "load",
      "timeout": 45000,
    },
  },
  // 2. Wait ~12–15s for Cloudflare's managed challenge to auto-clear. The title
  //    flips from "Just a moment..." to the real page title once cleared.
  { "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 15000 } },
  // 3. Extract the __NEXT_DATA__ JSON in-page — Next.js inlines it as a
  //    <script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">…</script> element.
  //    Parse in-page and return the projected fields (not the whole payload).
  {
    "method": "evaluate",
    "params": {
      "content": "(()=>{const el=document.getElementById('__NEXT_DATA__'); if(!el) return JSON.stringify({title:document.title, nextData:null}); return JSON.stringify({title:document.title, nextData:JSON.parse(el.textContent)});})()",
    },
  },
]
```

Confirm the returned `title` is not `"Just a moment..."` before trusting `nextData`. Parse the agent object out of `nextData` per step 4.

4. **Read the agent object** — **field names differ between the two page types**:

   **Agent profile page** (`/agent/{id}/{slug}`) — at `props.pageProps.data.agent`:

   | JSON path          | Meaning                                                    |
   | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
   | `bizname_t`        | Display name, e.g. `"Eleen Ooi"`                           |
   | `contact_s`        | Raw phone, no formatting, e.g. `"0122829900"`              |
   | `mail_s`           | Email, e.g. `"eleenestates@outlook.com"`                   |
   | `org_name_s`       | Agency slug, e.g. `"cbdproperties"` (lowercase, no spaces) |
   | `agent_position_s` | Position/title text, e.g. `"Real Estate..."`               |
   | `uid_i`            | Numeric agent id matching the URL `{id}`                   |

   **Listing page** (`/listing/{sale|rent}/{id}/...`) — at `props.pageProps.JSONdata.result.agent`:

   | JSON path                     | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
   | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | `agent_bizname`               | Display name as shown on listing card, e.g. `"DANIEL KHO"` (often UPPERCASE on listings)                                                                                                                     |
   | `agent_name`                  | **Legal name** from BOVAEP registry, e.g. `"KHO CHEE YONG"` — frequently different from `agent_bizname`. Report `agent_bizname` as the public-facing answer unless caller specifically wants the legal name. |
   | `agent_ph`                    | Raw phone, e.g. `"0162690803"`                                                                                                                                                                               |
   | `email`                       | Email, e.g. `"danielkho24@gmail.com"`                                                                                                                                                                        |
   | `agency` (a.k.a. `agent_com`) | Full agency name, e.g. `"IQI REALTY SDN. BHD."`                                                                                                                                                              |
   | `agent_id`                    | BOVAEP/PEA registration, e.g. `"REN 16300"` or `"PEA 3651"`                                                                                                                                                  |
   | `uid`                         | Numeric agent id — use to construct the canonical `/agent/{uid}/{slug}` URL                                                                                                                                  |

5. **Normalize the phone** to E.164. Malaysian mobile numbers start with `01` (e.g. `012…`, `016…`, `017…`, `018…`, `019…`, `011…`, `013…`, `014…`, `015…`). Strip any non-digit characters, drop the leading `0`, prepend `+60`. Examples: `0122829900` → `+60122829900`; `016-269 0803` → `+60162690803`. Keep the original raw string as `phone_raw` so the caller can verify.

6. **Output** the JSON envelope from the Expected Output schema below. If the field genuinely isn't in `__NEXT_DATA__` (rare — observed only when the agent record is suspended/archived), fall back to the Browser fallback below.

### Browser fallback (rare — only when `__NEXT_DATA__` is missing or stripped)

Older PRO-tier accounts or archived listings occasionally render with `__NEXT_DATA__` absent or with the contact fields blanked. In that case revert to the on-page click-to-reveal flow — it's reliable, just slower:

1. On the **agent profile page**, the phone is shown as a button labeled `01X XXX XXXX` (last 4 digits masked) next to a green `WHATSAPP` button. Click the masked-phone button to reveal the full number:
   ```jsonc
   "commands": [
     { "method": "click", "params": { "selector": "button:has(span)" } },
     { "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 2000 } },
     { "method": "evaluate", "params": { "content": "(()=>JSON.stringify({phone:[...document.querySelectorAll('button')].map(b=>b.innerText).find(t=>/01\\d/.test(t)&&!/XXXX/.test(t))||null}))()" } }
   ]
   ```
   (Confirm the masked-phone button via `snapshot` if the `button:has(span)` guess is too broad; the reveal updates the button text in place, e.g. `012 282 XXXX` → `012 282 9900`.)
   The masked-phone button text updates in place from `012 282 XXXX` → `012 282 9900`. The `WHATSAPP` button next to it triggers a `window.open(wa.me/<phone>)` that gets popup-blocked in headless sessions — don't rely on it for extraction.
2. **Email cannot be revealed via UI** — the `SEND ENQUIRY` button opens a contact form that asks for the _visitor's_ email + message; the agent's email never appears in the rendered UI. If `mail_s` / `email` is absent from `__NEXT_DATA__` _and_ the click-reveal flow is your only path, set `email: null` and `email_form_only: true`.
3. On **listing pages**, the on-card phone affordances (`WHATSAPP`, `MOBILE CALL`) under "OTHER WAYS TO ENQUIRE" do **not** flip the UI to show a number — they each fire a `window.open` that's popup-blocked. From a listing page, the reliable click-reveal path is to navigate to the agent's profile (the contact card has an `/agent/{uid}/{slug}` anchor on the agent's name) and reveal there. Many listing descriptions also contain the agent's phone written into the body text by the agent themselves — that's a noisy source, prefer `__NEXT_DATA__`.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **Cloudflare managed challenge is mandatory.** a direct HTTP fetch (no browser) and any plain HTTP client return a 403 with `cf-mitigated: challenge` and the JS-only `"Just a moment..."` interstitial. Only a real Chromium with `a stealth + residential-proxy session` clears it. First navigation needs **10–15s** of post-load wait — calling `a title read` immediately will return `"Just a moment..."`.
- **`__NEXT_DATA__` is the goldmine — and the UI lies about what's hidden.** The HTML rendered into the visible DOM masks phones as `01X XXX XXXX` and offers no email at all. The exact same page's `<script id="__NEXT_DATA__">` block contains both fields in plaintext (`contact_s` + `mail_s` on agent pages, `agent_ph` + `email` on listing pages). Do not waste turns clicking reveal buttons unless `__NEXT_DATA__` is unexpectedly absent.
- **Field names differ between agent profile and listing pages.** Agent profile uses Solr-style suffixed keys (`contact_s`, `mail_s`, `bizname_t`, `org_name_s`); listing pages use a `agent` sub-object with descriptive keys (`agent_ph`, `email`, `agent_bizname`, `agency`). Both are documented in step 4 above. Don't assume one schema — check the URL path first.
- **Two name fields on listings: `agent_name` ≠ `agent_bizname`.** `agent_name` is the legal name registered with BOVAEP (Malaysian Board of Valuers, Appraisers, Estate Agents and Property Managers), e.g. `"KHO CHEE YONG"`. `agent_bizname` is the public-facing display name, e.g. `"DANIEL KHO"`. The site UI exclusively shows `agent_bizname` — report that as `name` unless the caller specifically asks for the registered legal name.
- **Listing-page `agent_bizname` is often UPPERCASE** (`"DANIEL KHO"`) while agent-profile `bizname_t` is Title Case (`"Daniel Kho"`). Normalize to Title Case in the output if you care about presentation consistency.
- **License-number format is non-uniform.** `REN 16300` = Registered Estate Negotiator. `PEA 3651` = Probationary Estate Agent. `E (…)` / `VE (…)` exist for fully-registered Estate Agents and Valuers. Surface the raw string; don't try to canonicalize.
- **Phone format quirks.** `contact_s` / `agent_ph` are returned without dashes (`"0162690803"`). Some agent records have the phone _also_ embedded in listing-description body text in stylized Unicode (e.g. `𝟎𝟏𝟔𝟐𝟔𝟗𝟎𝟖𝟎𝟑`) — that's noisy, ignore it. Trust `agent_ph` / `contact_s`. Malaysian mobile prefixes observed: `010`-`019`. To E.164, strip leading `0`, prepend `+60`.
- **The "SEND ENQUIRY" button opens a contact form, not a mailto.** The form fields are _the visitor's_ full name, email and mobile — the agent's email is never exposed via this UI affordance. Do not submit this form during scraping (it would send a real lead to the agent).
- **`WHATSAPP` buttons rely on `window.open(...)` and get popup-blocked** in headless Browserbase sessions. They never produce an inspectable `wa.me/<phone>` href in the DOM. Don't try to harvest the phone via WhatsApp click.
- **Don't trust `data.org_name_s` as the human-readable agency.** It's a slug (`"iqirealty"`, `"cbdproperties"`). The listing-page `agent.agency` / `agent.agent_com` field is the proper display name (`"IQI REALTY SDN. BHD."`, `"CBD PROPERTIES SDN. BHD."`).
- **Agent profile URLs are case-insensitive in the slug.** `/agent/101419/daniel-kho`, `/agent/101419/DANIEL%20KHO`, and `/agent/101419` all resolve to the same page. The numeric `{uid}` is the only stable identifier.
- **`robots.txt` is generous** — `/agent/...` and `/listing/...` are not in the Disallow list (only `/admin/`, `/search/`, `/user/...` are). `Crawl-delay: 10` is advisory; keep request rate sane.
- **Cookies / sign-in are not required.** All the data above is present in the unauthenticated page payload. Don't burn turns trying to log in.
- **Email is sometimes missing from `__NEXT_DATA__`** when the agent has set their profile to hide email (free-tier accounts more often than PRO-tier). When `mail_s` / `agent.email` is `""` or absent, report `email: null` with `email_form_only: true` — don't fabricate one from the listing description.
- **Iteration cost note**: per-iteration cost is dominated by the Browserbase session minutes (the stealth solver adds a few seconds to first-load). Budget ~15–30s per agent if reusing a session, or ~30–45s if creating a fresh session each time. Reuse sessions when bulk-extracting.
