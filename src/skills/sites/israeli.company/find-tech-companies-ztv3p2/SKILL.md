# Find Israeli Tech-Sector Companies and Companies With Israeli Ties

## Purpose

Enumerate brand entries on `israeli.company` that the site has classified as belonging to the technology sector — either Israeli-founded/owned companies, or non-Israeli companies the site has documented as having ties to Israel (Israeli subsidiaries, founders, investments, supply-chain links, public statements, etc.). The skill returns a list of `{title, slug, url, tag_ids}` for every matching brand, and (optionally) the per-brand metadata block parsed from each brand's HTML page: `verdict`, `multinational`, `founded`, `founders`, `parent_company`, `child_companies`, `headquarters`, `belongs_to`, `in_the_news`. Read-only — never POSTs, never logs in.

## When to Use

- A user asks "what tech companies on israeli.company are flagged as Israeli or having Israeli ties?"
- A user wants a filtered list by tech sub-sector — fintech, healthtech, cybersecurity, mobility, agritech, etc.
- A user needs counts of brands tagged with technology categories (e.g. "how many entries does israeli.company have under Health Tech & Life Sciences?").
- A user asks about a specific company (e.g. "is Microsoft an Israeli company per israeli.company?") and wants the site's structured verdict + details.
- An analyst wants to bulk-export the tech-sector brand catalog for downstream processing.

## Workflow

The site is a public WordPress install with `/wp-json/wp/v2/*` fully exposed, unauthenticated, no rate-limit observed, Cloudflare cached. **Use the WP REST API for listing/filtering — it is dramatically faster than scraping and returns clean JSON.** The HTML page is only needed when the user wants per-brand detail fields (verdict, founders, HQ, etc.), because the REST API returns empty `content`/`excerpt` for these posts.

### Step 1 — Resolve the tech-sector tag IDs

Tech sectors are stored as WordPress `post_tag` taxonomy terms. Either hardcode the canonical IDs below, or re-discover them with a search query (the IDs are stable but counts shift as new brands are added).

```
GET https://israeli.company/wp-json/wp/v2/tags?per_page=100&search=tech
```

Canonical tech-sector tag IDs as of 2025-10 (counts as of 2026-05):

| Tag ID | Slug                               | Name                                         | Count   |
| ------ | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| 4      | `technology`                       | Technology (general)                         | 490     |
| 6172   | `health-tech-life-sciences`        | Health Tech & Life Sciences                  | 1,568   |
| 6170   | `industrial-technologies`          | Industrial Technologies                      | 759     |
| 6171   | `agriculture-food-technologies`    | Agriculture & Food Technologies              | 625     |
| 6165   | `media-entertainment-technologies` | Media & Entertainment Technologies           | 439     |
| 6169   | `fintech-insurtech`                | Fintech & Insurtech                          | 392     |
| 6174   | `automotive-mobility-technologies` | Automotive & Mobility Technologies           | 290     |
| 6176   | `energy-tech`                      | Energy Tech                                  | 216     |
| 6173   | `education-knowledge-technologies` | Education & Knowledge Technologies           | 149     |
| 6193   | `fintech`                          | Fintech (legacy)                             | 24      |
| 6168   | `cybersecurity`                    | Cybersecurity (resolve via slug — see below) | ~varies |
| 6259   | `information-technology`           | Information Technology                       | 8       |
| 815    | `wearables-smart-tech`             | Wearables smart tech                         | 5       |

Use the slug-based lookup when you need to pin a tag without trusting the cached ID: `GET /wp-json/wp/v2/tags?slug=technology` → returns the term with current `id` and `count`.

### Step 2 — Enumerate posts per tag

```
GET https://israeli.company/wp-json/wp/v2/posts?tags={tag_id}&per_page=100&page={N}&_fields=id,slug,title,link,tags,date
```

- `per_page` max is 100. `X-WP-Total` and `X-WP-TotalPages` response headers tell you how many pages remain.
- `_fields` is a comma-separated allow-list — use it to keep payloads small (the default response is ~4× larger and still has empty `content`).
- The `tags` query param accepts a CSV list (`tags=4,6172`) but the join is **OR (union)**, not AND. To find brands with multiple specific tags simultaneously, fetch each tag's list and compute the intersection client-side using the `id` field, or filter on the `tags` array returned per post.
- Titles follow a strict pattern: `"Is {Brand} an Israeli Company?"`. Strip the prefix/suffix to recover the brand name.
- The `categories` field on every post is `[1]` ("Brands") — informational only, do not filter on it.

To get a deduplicated **union of all tech-sector brands**, fetch every tag in step 1's table and union by `id`.

### Step 3 (optional) — Fetch per-brand detail from the HTML page

The REST API returns empty `content` / `excerpt` for these posts — Israeli-ties details live only in the rendered HTML body. Fetch the post's `link` URL and extract the structured block. The block sits inside `<main>` and uses a flat key/value layout you can regex out:

```
Israeli or Not: {Yes|No|Partially|...}
Multinational: {Yes|No}
Founded: {YYYY}
Founder(s): {Name, Name, ...}
Parent Company: {Brand|None}
Child Companies: {Brand, Brand, ...}
Location/ Headquarters: {City, Region, Country}
{Brand} belongs to: {Sector, Sub-sector, ...}
In the News: {short blurb}
```

The unverified-content disclaimer string `"The content on this page is not verified yet"` appears as an HTML comment for un-curated entries — surface this as a `verified: false` flag on the result if present.

### Step 4 — Return results

Aggregate Step 2 (and optional Step 3) into a single JSON list. If the user asked for a specific subsector, return only that tag's entries. If they asked broadly for "tech", return the union across all tags in Step 1's table.

### Browser fallback

If the WP REST API ever stops responding or you must screenshot the catalog UI, the human-readable archive pages mirror the API exactly:

- `https://israeli.company/technology/` — paginated archive for tag id 4
- `https://israeli.company/health-tech-life-sciences/` — tag id 6172
- `https://israeli.company/fintech-insurtech/` — tag id 6169
- `https://israeli.company/?s={query}&post_type=post` — site-wide full-text search

The archive pages render server-side with no JS gating; a `browserless_agent` `goto` (`waitUntil: "load"`) then a `text`/`evaluate` on `main` (or `body`) works without stealth or a residential proxy in our testing. Each archive item is a card linking to `/is-{brand-slug}-an-israeli-company/`. The detail page renders the same key/value block described in Step 3.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **REST API `content` and `excerpt` are intentionally empty** for every brand post — the site stores the verdict/founders/HQ block as native HTML in the template, not as post body. Do not waste calls trying `_fields=content` and concluding the post is empty; fetch the `link` URL instead.
- **Multi-tag query is OR, not AND.** `?tags=4,6168` returns the union (anything tagged Technology _or_ Cybersecurity). For an AND intersection, fetch each tag separately and intersect the `id` sets. WordPress does not expose `tags__and` over the public REST endpoint.
- **Only `category=1` (Brands) exists.** The single category covers all 9,963 brand posts — categories are not a useful filter. Tags (`post_tag` taxonomy) are the real classifier.
- **Tag IDs are stable but counts drift.** New brands get added monthly (last-mod dates in `sitemap_index.xml` show fresh activity through 2025-09). Re-resolve via `/wp-json/wp/v2/tags?slug=...` if you need today's count.
- **There are overlapping legacy/new tag pairs** — e.g. `fintech` (id 6193, 24 posts) and `fintech-insurtech` (id 6169, 392 posts), or `biotechnology` (id 49, 3 posts) vs `biotechnology-pharma` (id 40, 9 posts) vs `health-tech-life-sciences` (id 6172, 1568 posts). The newer six-thousand-range tags are the curated taxonomy; treat older low-id tags as historical/leftover and prefer the 6000-series when ambiguous.
- **Title pattern is rigid:** `"Is {Brand} an Israeli Company?"`. Strip with `/^Is (.+) an Israeli Company\?$/`. Special cases retained: `Run:AI`, `RAID: Shadow Legends`, `Microsoft Xbox`, `Microsoft Gaming` — the brand name may contain punctuation.
- **HTML titles are HTML-encoded** in the REST JSON — `Health Tech &amp; Life Sciences` (note `&amp;`). Decode entities before display.
- **`X-Robots-Tag: noindex`** is set on the `/wp-json/` responses. The endpoints work, but Google won't have them — don't expect Google site-search to cover the API surface.
- **Cloudflare in front of the site.** Heavy/parallel scraping might trigger `__cf_bm` challenge issuance; if you hit a 403 on `/wp-json/`, retry via `browserless_agent` with `proxy: { proxy: "residential" }` (residential IP) rather than naked curl. No challenge was observed during ~20 sequential test calls without a proxy.
- **No anti-bot wall observed** on either the REST API or the public archive HTML pages during four rounds of testing. Skill does not require stealth or a residential proxy for the recommended API path, but adding `proxy: { proxy: "residential" }` for HTML detail fetches is cheap insurance if you parallelize.
- **The site also exposes custom post types** (`movies`, `alternatives`, `public-figures` per the sitemap), but they're NOT registered in `/wp-json/wp/v2/types` and not reachable as `/wp-json/wp/v2/{type}`. They are NOT part of the brand tech-sector catalog — do not include them in tech-company results.
- **The `excerpt` and `In the News` fields can contain politically charged blurbs** (e.g. "Continues to fire employees for protesting against the company's complicity in the genocide" on the Microsoft entry). Surface them verbatim; do not editorialize. The skill returns whatever the site has on record.
- **"Israeli or Not"** can take values beyond Yes/No — observed values include `Yes`, `No`, `Partially`. Don't hardcode a boolean enum; preserve the string.
- **Pagination cap**: with `per_page=100`, the Health Tech & Life Sciences tag (1,568 posts) needs 16 page requests. The site happily serves them sequentially; budget ~20 calls per large tag.
- **There is no GraphQL endpoint and no Algolia/Elasticsearch backing search.** The only programmatic surface is `/wp-json/wp/v2/*`. The `?s=` URL-param search is WordPress core, not a separate API.
