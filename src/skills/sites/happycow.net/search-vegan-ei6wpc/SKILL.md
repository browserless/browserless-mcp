      Lead with the server-rendered /searchmap/print?... endpoint — it honors

      metric=, page=, lat/lng or bb=) and returns a static HTML list of all
      matching venues (~180/page), behind Imperva's bot wall but reliably 200
      via a `browserless_agent` navigation with a residential proxy.

      Enrich each row with optional per-venue detail fetches to
      /reviews/{slug}-{venue_id} (schema.org Restaurant microdata + data-* attrs
      for lat/lng, photos, tags, hours) when the caller needs IDs/coords/photos
      beyond what print yields. Discover slug+ID via city-slug landing pages
      (/europe/.../<city>/, /north-america/usa/.../<city>/) which expose anchors
      with the canonical IDs.

    rationale: >-
      Fallback only when /searchmap/print is unreachable. Drive a
      `browserless_agent` residential-proxy session against /searchmap?... and
      read the rendered list. Slower and more expensive; same data is available
      cheaper via the print path.

# HappyCow Vegan Search

## Purpose

Search HappyCow for vegan, vegetarian, and veg-friendly restaurants — plus health-food stores, vegan stores, and other veg-friendly venues (bakeries, juice bars, ice cream, coffee) — in any location, honoring the full filter surface (diet/venue type, cuisine, features, price, rating, distance, sort) and return matches as structured JSON. Read-only — never clicks `Add a Place`, `Write a Review`, `Sign In`, `Bookmark`, or any mutation control.

## When to Use

- "List vegan and vegetarian restaurants within 10 km of Berlin, sorted by rating."
- "Find Italian-cuisine vegan spots with outdoor seating in Brooklyn."
- "Map all health-food stores within 5 miles of Austin, TX."
- Any read-only HappyCow listing extraction — pulling the full venue catalog for a metro, neighborhood, or lat/lng radius.

## Workflow

HappyCow's `/searchmap?...` UI hydrates the venue list via an internal XHR (`GET /ajax/views/searchmap/venues?...`). That XHR is **confirmed-blocked from cookieless fetch** (returns the HappyCow 404 page; requires PHPSESSID + `X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest` from a hydrated browser session — see Site-Specific Gotchas). The good news: HappyCow ships a **server-rendered printable view at `/searchmap/print?...` that honors every filter the UI exposes** and returns a static HTML list of all matching venues (paginated ~180/page). Lead with that; fall back to scripted browsing only when the print path is unreachable.

Anti-bot: HappyCow is behind Imperva (Incapsula). A proxy-less navigation is 403'd at the bot-check; a `browserless_agent` call carrying a residential proxy returns 200. **Set `proxy: { proxy: "residential" }` (optionally `proxyCountry: "us"`) on EVERY call** — proxies are mandatory for every fetch on this site, not just the browser fallback.

### Step 1 — Build the query

No session bootstrapping is needed — a `browserless_agent` session comes up with its residential proxy on the first call and persists across calls, keyed by that `proxy` config. Just build the query URL and hand it to a `goto` + in-page `evaluate` (below). Map the user's location + filters → URL params. The full param schema (extracted from `/js/modules/happycow.common.search.map.js` + the search form):

| `metric`               | Distance unit                                                                    | `metric=km` or `metric=mi`                                                           |

| `page`                 | 1-based page for pagination                                                      | `page=2`                                                                             |

**Diet / venue-type filter IDs** (`filters=` is dash-joined; each token corresponds to a button `name=` in the form):

Restaurants: `vegan`, `vegetarian`, `vegfriendly`, `veganprofessional` (chains), `delivery`, `catering`, `foodtruck`, `chains`.
Stores & more: `bakery`, `coffee`, `juicebar`, `icecream`, `health` (health store), `vegshop`, `veganStores` (vegan-only stores), `farmers`, `marketvendor`, `bnb`, `spa`, `organization`, `other`.

**Cuisine / food-type IDs** (`ft=` is comma-joined; values verified against the in-page filter buttons):

| ID  | Cuisine       | ID  | Cuisine       | ID  | Cuisine        |
| --- | ------------- | --- | ------------- | --- | -------------- |
| 5   | American      | 18  | Mediterranean | 32  | Catering       |
| 6   | Pizza         | 19  | Fast food     | 34  | European       |
| 7   | Chinese       | 20  | Salad bar     | 35  | French         |
| 8   | Indian        | 21  | Juice bar     | 36  | Fusion         |
| 9   | International | 22  | Beer/Wine     | 37  | German         |
| 10  | Italian       | 23  | Delivery      | 39  | Middle Eastern |
| 11  | Japanese      | 24  | Take out      | 40  | Spanish        |
| 12  | Macrobiotic   | 25  | Mexican       | 41  | Taiwanese      |
| 13  | Organic       | 28  | Asian         | 42  | Vietnamese     |
| 14  | Raw Food      | 29  | Bakery        | 43  | Gluten-free    |
| 15  | Thai          | 30  | British       | 45  | Latin          |
| 16  | Western       | 31  | Caribbean     | 46  | Brazilian      |
| 17  | Buffet        | 47  | Australian    | 48  | Breakfast      |
| 49  | African       | 50  | Korean        |     |                |

**Feature / amenity IDs** (`f=` is comma-joined):

| ID  | Feature               |
| --- | --------------------- |
| 1   | Outdoor seating       |
| 2   | Reservations required |
| 3   | Wheelchair accessible |
| 4   | Accepts credit cards  |
| 5   | Cash only             |
| 6   | Free Wi-Fi            |

**Rating / Open-now / Price** — the searchmap UI does **not** expose rating-min, "open now" boolean, or a price filter as standalone URL params. Sort by `order=rating` and filter the response. Open-now is encoded through the time-slider as `openAt=<HHMM>&openAtDay=<Mon|Tue|...>` (separate handling from a simple `open=1` flag). Price tier comes back per-venue from the detail page (`itemprop="priceRange"`) — filter client-side.

### Step 2 — Fetch the printable list (the optimal path)

Navigate to the print URL and parse the server-rendered HTML **in-page** with a single `browserless_agent` call (residential proxy mandatory). Fold the card extraction into the `evaluate` so you return a compact JSON projection, not raw HTML:

```jsonc
// browserless_agent  (QS = location=Berlin%2C+Germany&metric=km&radius=10&filters=vegan-vegetarian&order=rating)
{
  "proxy": { "proxy": "residential", "proxyCountry": "us" },
  "commands": [
    {
      "method": "goto",
      "params": {
        "url": "https://www.happycow.net/searchmap/print?<QS>&page=1",
        "waitUntil": "load",
        "timeout": 45000,
      },
    },
    {
      "method": "evaluate",
      "params": {
        "content": "(()=>{ /* split on <div class=\"mt-3 flex items-center\">, parse each card's name+diet, distance, rating-list SVG paths, address+phone; also read the <h3> heading and the 'Total Results: N' radius line */ return JSON.stringify({ total_results, heading, venues }); })()",
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

`evaluate` returns its value under `.value`. The HTML is server-rendered. Key extractable fields per venue card:

- **Name + diet type** — heading line `<NAME> (<DIET>) <distance> <unit>` where `<DIET>` is one of `Vegan`, `Vegetarian`, `Veg-options`, `Health Store`, `Veg Store`, `Vegan Store`, `Other`. HTML entities (`&#039;` for `'`, `&amp;` for `&`) appear in names — un-escape.
- **Distance** — number + unit (`km` or `mi`) immediately after the diet paren.
- **Rating (stars)** — `<ul class="rating-list">` with exactly five `<li>` children. Each `<li>` contains one `<path d="...">`. The first ~30 chars of the `d` attribute identify the star state:
  - `M480-219.913` → full star (+1.0)
  - `M358.544-253.457` → half star (+0.5)
  - `M480-627.109` → empty star (+0)

  Sum across the 5 li → rating (0.0 – 5.0).

- **Address + phone** — `<p class="mt-3 font-normal">Street, City, Country, Postal - Telephone: +CC-...</p>`. When phone is unlisted the line reads `... - Telephone: N/A`. Card boundary: split the HTML on `<div class="mt-3 flex items-center">`.

The page header carries two crucial scope fields:

- **Heading** — `<h3>Vegetarian Restaurants & Health Food Stores</h3>` (or store-only/restaurant-only variant depending on filters).
- **Radius line** — `<p>Within a radius of <X> <km|mi> of your location - Total Results: <N></p>`. This gives you `total_results` for the region.

### Step 3 — Paginate

The print page returns ~180 cards/page (180 was observed for Berlin page 1 and page 2 with `radius=10&metric=km`, with `Total Results: 1833`). Iterate `page=1, page=2, ...` until you've consumed `Total Results / 180` pages (round up), or until a page returns zero cards.

Issue one `browserless_agent` call per page (each with the residential proxy), incrementing `&page=${PAGE}` in the `goto` URL and re-running the same parsing `evaluate`. Alternatively, chain several pages inside ONE call's `commands` array (goto page 1 → evaluate → goto page 2 → evaluate → …) so the whole crawl runs in a single session. Stop when a page returns zero cards or once you've consumed `ceil(Total Results / 180)` pages.

### Step 4 — Enrich (optional, only when caller needs `venue_id`, `slug`, `lat/lng`, photos, hours, website, features, cuisine tags, claimed-by-owner)

The print view **does not include venue IDs, slugs, lat/lng, photos, or feature/cuisine tags** — only what's listed above. For richer fields, two enrichment paths:

**(a) City-slug landing pages** — `/europe/<country>/<city>/`, `/north-america/usa/<state>/<city>/`, `/asia/<country>/<city>/`. These pages render ~50 curated venue cards as `<a href="/reviews/<slug>-<venue_id>">...</a>` anchors with the data-* map markers (`data-lat`, `data-lng`, `data-vegonly`, `data-new`) and full thumbnail URLs. Best when the caller's location is a known city and they want top venues with full IDs.

`browserless_agent` (residential proxy) → `goto https://www.happycow.net/europe/germany/berlin/` then `evaluate` to pull the anchors: match `href="/reviews/[a-z0-9-]+-(\d+)"` across the DOM to yield slug→venue_id pairs (~54 unique for Berlin), plus the `data-lat`/`data-lng`/`data-vegonly`/`data-new` attrs and thumbnail URLs on each marker.

Then build the canonical URL: `https://www.happycow.net/reviews/{slug}-{venue_id}`.

**(b) Venue detail page** — `/reviews/{slug}-{venue_id}` returns full schema.org `Restaurant` microdata plus HappyCow `data-*` attrs. Fields available (verified on `/reviews/19-77-vegan-diner-bar-ramones-museum-berlin-414540`):

Detail-page fetches are slow (~880 KB HTML each) and rate-cost adds up — only enrich when the caller asks for fields beyond the print summary.

### Step 5 — Emit JSON

Return the schema in **Expected Output** below. Populate `bounding_box` from the print page's "X km of your location" header + the geocoded center if you can recover lat/lng (the `/searchmap?...` HTML embeds `data-lat`/`data-lng` on `#location` after geocode — run one `browserless_agent` `goto` (residential proxy) against the `/searchmap?location=...` URL and `evaluate` the `#location` input's `data-lat`/`data-lng`, then build bbox from `radius`).

### Step 6 — Session teardown

No session-release step is needed, and nothing tears down on return — a `browserless_agent` session **persists across calls, keyed by the `proxy` config**. Keeping a multi-step flow (warm-up → nav → extract → paginate, or geocode-grab → print-crawl) inside ONE call's `commands` array is the convenient way to hold cookies/session across steps; a later call repeating the same `proxy` reconnects to that same session, while dropping or changing it lands in a different one.

### Browser fallback (only if `/searchmap/print` returns 403 / 5xx)

If the print path is unreachable (Imperva rate-limit, server outage), load the live `/searchmap?...` URL in a residential-proxy `browserless_agent` call and read the rendered venue list. **The XHR endpoint `/ajax/views/searchmap/venues` is confirmed-blocked to cookieless GETs** (see gotcha), so this path requires actually rendering the page with JS. Do it all inside a single call's `commands` array so hydration cookies persist:

```jsonc
// browserless_agent
{
  "proxy": { "proxy": "residential", "proxyCountry": "us" },
  "commands": [
    {
      "method": "goto",
      "params": {
        "url": "https://www.happycow.net/searchmap?<QS>",
        "waitUntil": "load",
        "timeout": 45000,
      },
    },
    { "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 4000 } }, // XHR hydration lands 2–4s after load
    {
      "method": "evaluate",
      "params": {
        "content": "(()=>{ /* read data-id / data-lat / data-lng off the rendered venue cards; JSON.stringify a compact projection */ })()",
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

Prefer the in-page `evaluate` above (compact JSON) over `snapshot` — the full a11y tree of a searchmap can exceed the result-size limit; use `snapshot` only to confirm the cards rendered if `evaluate` comes back empty. Per-card parsing of the rendered list mirrors the venue-detail microdata schema above.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **Imperva (Incapsula) anti-bot is the universal gate.** A proxy-less navigation of `/searchmap?...` returns a 403 with an `_Incapsula_Resource` iframe. A `browserless_agent` call carrying `proxy: { proxy: "residential" }` returns 200 for `/searchmap?...`, `/searchmap/print?...`, `/europe/.../<city>/`, and `/reviews/{slug}-{id}` — the residential proxy is **mandatory on every call**, not just the browser fallback. Verified 2026-05-16 on Berlin and Austin queries.
- **`/ajax/views/searchmap/venues` is confirmed-blocked for cookieless XHR.** Reproduced a direct cookieless POST with `X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest` + `Accept: application/json` + correct `Referer` + `User-Agent` — every variant returned the HappyCow 404 "Page Not Found" HTML. Endpoint requires a `PHPSESSID` cookie established by a prior `/searchmap?...` page load (and likely a CSRF/JS-derived token verified by the Laravel middleware). **Don't waste turns hand-crafting cookieless XHRs to this endpoint — it doesn't work.** The optimal path is `/searchmap/print?...`; the browser fallback exercises the XHR through a real session, where cookies + headers are set automatically.
- **The print page does NOT include venue IDs, slugs, lat/lng, photos, or tag chips.** Only name, diet type, distance, 5-star rating, full address, and phone. If the caller needs richer fields, enrich via city-slug pages (for top ~50 venues with IDs) or per-venue detail pages.
- **Default radius is 15 (units), not from `limit_distance`.** Omitting both `radius` and a bbox returns the server's default 15-of-the-selected-metric. Use `radius=N&metric=km|mi` explicitly. The deprecated `limit_distance=` parameter from older URLs is silently ignored by the print route.
- **The form's `s=` URL param is a view-state byte, not a diet filter.** The page sets `s=2` for the user-visible search panel; the internal AJAX rewrites it to `s=3`. Diet filtering is via `filters=vegan-vegetarian-...` (dash-joined), **not** via `s`. A request without `filters=` returns all venue types.
- **HappyCow geolocates a `location=` string server-side and embeds the resolved `data-lat`/`data-lng` on the searchmap page's `#location` input.** To recover the geocoded center, scrape that input. Free-form like `"Shibuya, Tokyo"` and `"Austin, TX"` and `"78704"` all resolve cleanly. Direct lat/lng pairs work too — pass `lat=&lng=&radius=&metric=` and skip `location=`.
- **The `bb` (bounding-box) param has signature `swLat,swLng,neLat,neLng`** (south-west then north-east, per `/js/search.map.js` `locationEl.setAttribute('data-bounds', ...)`). When `bb` is present, `lat`/`lng`/`radius` are still useful for distance-from-center sort but the bbox is the authoritative spatial scope. Required when the user provides a `searchmap` URL with `bb=`.
- **Pagination on `/searchmap/print` returns ~180 cards/page regardless of the `limit` UI hint.** `limit=18|27|81` is the searchmap _map UI's_ visible-marker cap, not the print page's serving size. Iterate `page=1, page=2, ...` until you've consumed `Total Results / 180` pages.
- **HappyCow rating extraction is path-based, not color-based.** All five `<li>` star SVGs use `class="text-yellow-500"` regardless of fill state. Distinguish state by the first 12 chars of the `<path d="...">` attribute: `M480-219.913` = full, `M358.544-253.457` = half, `M480-627.109` = empty. Sum full + 0.5 × half for the rating.
- **Diet type spelling in print HTML uses six values, not the form-name set.** The card heading parens contain one of: `Vegan`, `Vegetarian`, `Veg-options` (≈ veg-friendly), `Health Store`, `Veg Store`, `Vegan Store`, `Other`. Map these to your output diet field; do not expect `Veg-friendly` literally (it's spelled `Veg-options` in the print view).
- **HappyCow geocodes the world differently from the request IP.** A US residential-proxy navigation of `/searchmap?location=Berlin%2C+Germany` correctly returns Berlin venues — the geocode is location-driven, not IP-driven. No need to swap `proxyCountry` per locale. The page does include a `data-is-user-in-europe` flag for GDPR but it doesn't affect search results.
- **`api.happycow.net` is NOT the venue API.** It's a Symfony API Platform serving the shop products, user auth, top-ambassadors, venue claims, and a few partner-pricing resources. The venue-search resources are not exposed there. (Verified by hitting `https://api.happycow.net/index.json` — 36 resource classes listed, none of them venue-search.)
- **`map.happycow.net` is a tile / cluster server, not a JSON places API.** Direct GET returns 500 with no usable schema for skill purposes.
- **Free-form keywords use `term=`, comma-separated, not space-joined.** The UI's "Add keyword" widget appends each term as a separate button; the URL joins them with commas: `term=ramen,gluten-free`. Single-word `term=ramen` works too.
- **"Open now" is not a single boolean flag.** The UI exposes a time-slider that emits `openAt=<HHMM>&openAtDay=<Mon|Tue|...>` URL params. For "open right now" use the current local time at the search location and current day-of-week.
- **Read-only.** Do not click `Add a Place`, `Write a Review`, `Bookmark`, `Sign In`, or any anchor under `/reviews/.../write` or `/members/...`. The `/reviews/{slug}-{id}/write` URL is a review-submission form, not a read-only detail view.
- **Region-wide totals are reliable; "matched cards count" can lag.** The header's `Total Results: N` is the authoritative region-wide hit count. The visible cards on a single page are clamped at ~180, so a page-1 fetch alone is _not_ the full picture for any metro with > 180 hits.
- **Sandbox limitation observed during build:** the browser-fallback step (rendering `/searchmap?...` with JS hydration) was validated only by code inspection of the JS bundles, not by live execution, from the restricted build sandbox. The static print-path navigation (`goto` + in-page `evaluate` over `/searchmap/print`) was fully validated end-to-end. If you run from a less-restricted environment the browser fallback should work — but `/searchmap/print` is the recommended path regardless.

Notes on the schema:

- `_source` indicates which path supplied this row. `"print"` rows have everything the print page yields and `null` for the enrichable fields; `"print+detail"` rows were merged with a `/reviews/{slug}-{id}` detail fetch; `"city-slug"` rows came from `/europe/.../<city>/` and have IDs but limited per-venue depth.
- `diet` is normalized (`vegan` / `vegetarian` / `veg-friendly` / `health-store` / `veg-store` / `vegan-store` / `other`); `diet_raw` preserves the source spelling (`Veg-options`, etc.).
- `phone` is `null` when print shows `"Telephone: N/A"`.
- When `bb=` was supplied or computed, `bounding_box` is populated; when only `radius`/`metric` were used, compute it from `resolved_center` ± `radius` (rough km↔degree conversion).
- For "candidate" / unverified status: if the print path 403s and the browser fallback can't be reached (e.g., DNS-restricted sandbox), emit `{"success": false, "reason": "anti_bot_wall", "diagnostic": "..."}` rather than partial data.
