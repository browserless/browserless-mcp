# Scout Trust Center Lookup

## Purpose

Given a security / compliance / privacy topic (e.g. `"SOC 2"`, `"GDPR"`, `"data residency"`, `"subprocessors"`, `"encryption at rest"`, `"incident response"`, `"data retention"`), return Scout's trust posture from `trust.scoutos.com`: certification badges, audit reports (with gated-access flags), policy documents, subprocessors (vendor name, purpose, region, URL), security control summaries by category, and the canonical access-request workflow URL. Returns structured JSON. **Read-only — never submits the access-request form, never accepts an NDA.**

## When to Use

- Vendor security review / due-diligence questionnaire automation against Scout.
- "Is Scout SOC 2 compliant?" / "Where is Scout's data hosted?" / "Does Scout use OpenAI as a subprocessor?" lookups.
- Pre-sales / procurement workflows that need to fetch Scout's policy doc catalog and flag which require NDA.
- Monitoring Scout's subprocessor list for changes (compare snapshot dates).

## Workflow

`trust.scoutos.com` is a **Vanta-hosted Trust Center** (Vanta SPA bundle served from `assets.vanta.com` via Cloudflare). All content is client-rendered after JS hydration. There is a public GraphQL endpoint at `https://trust.scoutos.com/graphql`, but every operation requires a Vanta-issued `signedQuery.signature` baked into the JS bundle — unsigned calls return `400 BAD_REQUEST {message:"Missing signature or signedAt"}` and mutated queries return `401 UNAUTHORIZED {message:"Invalid signature"}`. **Don't waste time trying to call GraphQL directly without driving the page** (verified iter-1). The robust path is: load the SPA in a real browser, wait for hydration, then extract the rendered DOM. Anti-bot is light — a plain `browserless_agent` call suffices; a residential proxy is optional (`proxy: { proxy: "residential" }`) and only worth adding if a run ever gets blocked.

### 1. Session model

A `browserless_agent` session persists across separate calls, keyed by the call's `proxy`/`profile` config — a later call with the same config reconnects to the same warmed browser and its hydrated client store. Batching the whole flow for a route (navigate → wait for hydration → extract, plus any pagination clicks) into **one** call's `commands` array is still the convenient default — it saves round-trips and avoids accidentally dropping the session config. There is no session-release step. Cloudflare in front of the Vanta CDN does not enforce a JS challenge, so stealth/proxy is not required.

### 2. Resolve the topic to the right page(s)

The Trust Center has four canonical routes — all are SPA routes off `trust.scoutos.com`:

| Route            | What it contains                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Fetch when topic matches…                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/`              | Overview: compliance badges (HIPAA, SOC 2, GDPR), first ~10 resources, first ~3 controls per category, first 4 subprocessors. Best single page for a "give me everything at a glance" query.                                    | "overview", "summary", "compliance", "certifications"                                                                                            |
| `/resources`     | Full list of 19 resources (policies, audit reports, BAAs). All Scout resources are **gated** — clicking "Request access" opens an NDA-style form.                                                                               | "SOC 2 report", "penetration test", "policy", "BAA", "audit", "incident response", "data retention", "access control", "risk management"         |
| `/controls`      | Security controls grouped by 4 categories — `Infrastructure security` (18), `Organizational security` (9+), `Product security` (4), `Internal security procedures` (20). Each control has a name, description, and pass status. | "encryption at rest", "MFA", "access control", "background checks", "penetration testing", "vulnerability management", any specific control name |
| `/subprocessors` | 19 third-party vendors with name, purpose, location, URL, description.                                                                                                                                                          | "subprocessors", "data residency", "where is data hosted", "third-party vendors", "AWS / GCP / OpenAI / Anthropic usage"                         |

For broad/ambiguous topics fetch all four. For narrow topics (e.g. `"SOC 2"`) `/` + `/resources` is enough.

### 3. Drive the SPA and wait for hydration

For each route, chain these commands in one `browserless_agent` call:

```jsonc
{ "method": "goto",           "params": { "url": "https://trust.scoutos.com/<route>", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } },
{ "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 3000 } },   // wait for the GraphQL fetches + render
{ "method": "text",           "params": { "selector": "body" } }
```

The 3-second wait covers `fetchDataForTrustReport`, `fetchCustomizableControlsDataForExternalTrustCenter`, and `SubprocessorsSectionPaginated`. If the extracted text is missing the `## Resources` / `## Controls` / `## Subprocessors` heading, the page is still loading — add another `{ "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 2000 } }` before the `text` call and re-run.

### 4. Paginate the Controls page

`/controls` shows only the **first 10 controls of each category**. Pagination buttons have `aria-label="Next page"` (no visible text) and `aria-label="Previous page"`. There is one pair per paginated section. To capture all controls:

Chain these onto the `/controls` call (after the initial `goto` + wait + first extract):

```jsonc
// Click each "Next page" button in order to advance each section past its first 10.
{ "method": "evaluate",       "params": { "content": "(()=>{const btns=[...document.querySelectorAll('button[aria-label=\"Next page\"]')];btns.forEach(b=>b.click());return btns.length;})()" } },
{ "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 2000 } },
{ "method": "text",           "params": { "selector": "body" } }
```

(The click count comes back under `.value`.)

Section pagination labels (`"1 to 10 of 18 results"`, `"11 to 18 of 18 results"`) tell you when you're done. `Product security` (4 controls) is never paginated. `Organizational security` doesn't show a "Next" button when its second page is empty.

### 5. Extract structured fields

Parse the extracted page text (or fold the parsing into an `evaluate` that runs in-page). The DOM patterns observed in iter-1:

- **Compliance badges** (Overview page, `## Compliance` section): plain-text labels `HIPAA`, `SOC 2`, `GDPR`. The SOC 2 badge is an image at `https://assets.vanta.com/static/soc2_badge.273e2b64.webp`. Other certifications appear as text-only without badge images.
- **Resources** (`/resources` page, table rows under `## Resources`): each row contains the resource name + a category label (`Compliance Documentation`, `Business Association Agreement`, `Casco Security Remediation Verification Report`). All Scout resources include a `Request access` button — meaning **all are gated; no public direct-download links exist**. A `fa-lock` icon class on the Overview page (`/`) link list confirms gated status.
- **Controls** (`/controls` page, tables under each `### <category>` heading): each row is `Control name + Description (concatenated, no separator in markdown rendering) | <pass-icon-or-blank>`. The pass icon is `fa-circle-check alpaca-fa-solid`; a **blank Status cell** means the control is NOT passing (e.g. `Remote access MFA enforced` was observed blank on 2026-05-19 — likely an SLA window or in-remediation control). Capture both passing and non-passing controls; don't filter by status.
- **Subprocessors** (`/subprocessors` page, list under `## Subprocessors`): each entry is `<Name>•<Purpose>` followed by `<Location>` and a `<Description>` paragraph and a vendor URL. Some entries have a logo at `/logos/<domain>`. The bottom of the page repeats every subprocessor in plain-text form (`All subprocessors` block) — this is the cleanest extraction target because it has one record per vendor with consistent field order: `name`, `description`, `purpose`, `location`, `url`.

### 6. Build the access-request URL

The canonical access-request workflow URLs (read-only — your skill **never POSTs** the form):

| Purpose                                                | URL                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Open the request-access modal (full or limited access) | `https://trust.scoutos.com/?requestAccessOpen=true`                                                       |
| Open the modal pre-selecting a specific resource       | `https://trust.scoutos.com/?requestAccessOpen=true&requestedResources=<resourceId>`                       |
| "Reclaim access" (existing-access magic-link flow)     | Triggered from the same modal via `Already have access? Reclaim access`. Email-magic-link; no direct URL. |

Resource IDs are 24-char hex Mongo-style ObjectIds (e.g. `693c75bc32717159586b7c97` for the SOC 2 Type 2 Report). On the **Overview page** (`/`), each resource list item is an `<a href="/?requestAccessOpen=true&requestedResources=<id>">` — extract IDs from those `href`s. On `/resources`, each resource is a `<button>` (no href) whose ID lives in component state; to extract those, parse the Overview page or intercept the `fetchDataForTrustReport` GraphQL response (see Gotchas).

### 7. Return JSON matching the topic

Filter / rank the extracted data by the input topic. See Expected Output below for example shapes. Always include `topic`, `matches` (the topic-specific subset), `canonical_urls` (the routes you fetched), and `access_request_url`. Set `gated_access` true on every Scout resource (they all require an access request as of 2026-05-19) unless the resource URL begins with a host outside `trust.scoutos.com` (e.g. the Privacy Policy at `https://www.scoutos.com/legal/privacy-policy` is public).

### 8. Session teardown

No session-release step — there is simply nothing to release. Batching each route's full flow into one call's `commands` array keeps the hydrated client store live across the pagination clicks without you having to re-supply the session config; a later call reusing the same `proxy`/`profile` reconnects to the same session anyway.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **Vanta GraphQL is signed-only.** `POST https://trust.scoutos.com/graphql?operation=<name>` returns 400 without an `extensions.signedQuery` block, and 401 if the (query, signedAt, signature) triplet doesn't match what Vanta's signer issued. Signatures are baked into the JS bundle at `https://assets.vanta.com/static/index-trust-report.<hash>.js`. They appear NOT to have a hard TTL (a signature signed at 03:56 UTC was still accepted 14h later), but they rotate when the bundle version (`<html data-version="...">`) changes. **Confirmed dead-end for direct API access** — do not attempt to forge or replay; just drive the page.
- **`fetchDataForTrustReport` only fires on initial mount.** SPA route changes (`/` → `/resources` → `/controls`) do NOT re-fetch it; the resource catalog comes from a cached client-side store. If you need the raw GraphQL response, intercept `window.fetch` **before** the first navigation:

  ```jsonc
  { "method": "goto",     "params": { "url": "about:blank", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } },
  { "method": "evaluate", "params": { "content": "(()=>{window.__c=[];const o=window.fetch.bind(window);window.fetch=async(u,i)=>{const r=await o(u,i);if((typeof u==='string'?u:u.url).includes('/graphql')){try{const c=r.clone();window.__c.push({url:u,body:i&&i.body,resp:await c.text()});}catch(e){}}return r;};return'h';})()" } },
  { "method": "goto",     "params": { "url": "https://trust.scoutos.com/", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } },
  { "method": "evaluate", "params": { "content": "(()=>JSON.stringify(window.__c))()" } }
  ```

  Even this is brittle — a fresh `goto` may reset the JS context. Text extraction is more reliable.

- **Controls pagination is per-section, not per-page.** Don't assume one global "Next" — `/controls` has up to 4 paginators (one per category) all with the same `aria-label="Next page"`. Click them all to harvest every control. `Infrastructure security` paginates to "11 to 18 of 18"; `Internal security procedures` paginates to "11 to 20 of 20"; `Organizational security` has 9 controls and only one page; `Product security` has 4 controls and no pagination.
- **Blank Status cell ≠ failing control.** A control with no `fa-circle-check` icon may be passing in a different status (`disabled`, `not-applicable`, `in-progress`), passing offline, or simply rendering-quirked. Don't infer "non-compliant" from a blank cell — surface the raw status as `passing | other` in your JSON and let the caller decide. (Observed blanks on 2026-05-19: `Remote access MFA enforced`, `Anti-malware technology utilized`, `Password policy enforced`, `MDM system utilized`.)
- **All Scout resources are gated.** As of 2026-05-19, **every** resource on `trust.scoutos.com` (SOC 2 Type 2 Report, 14 policies, 4 BAAs, 2025 Penetration Test) requires an access request. No public-download URLs exist. The only public document is the Privacy Policy at `https://www.scoutos.com/legal/privacy-policy` — set `gated_access: false` only for that.
- **`fa-lock alpaca-fa-regular` is the gated marker** on Overview-page resource links. It renders as visible text (icon names leak into the markdown) — easy to grep for `fa-lock`.
- **Subprocessors page renders each vendor twice** (paginated table at top, then a full "All subprocessors" block at the bottom). Use the bottom block for extraction — it has consistent field order with no truncation. Paginated table caps at 10 per page; the bottom block lists all 19.
- **Subprocessor location strings are free-form text, not ISO codes.** Observed values: `USA`, `USA / Global`, `EU`. For data-residency lookups, normalize: anything containing `USA` → US; anything containing `EU` → EU; anything containing `Global` → multi-region. Only `Turbopuffer` was EU-only in our snapshot.
- **The `slugId` is in the HTML head** (`<head data-slugid="o79kvtsko6grw3xlu7hk6v">`) and the trust-report ID (`691cdf6d305c1790984fa04c`) is returned in every GraphQL response under `trust.trustReportBySlugId.id`. Cache these per-domain.
- **HIPAA, GDPR are text-only badges; SOC 2 has an image.** The Overview `## Compliance` block lists certifications as plain text; only SOC 2 has an associated image (`https://assets.vanta.com/static/soc2_badge.273e2b64.webp`). Don't look for image URLs for HIPAA / GDPR — they don't exist.
- **No audit-report dates exposed publicly.** The SOC 2 Type 2 Report and 2025 Penetration Test resources show only names + categories. Effective-date / report-period fields are gated behind the NDA. If your topic requires a date (e.g. "when was the latest SOC 2 audit?"), surface `audit_date: null, gated: true` and the access-request URL.
- **`Updated N minutes ago` on `/controls`** is Vanta's continuous-monitoring heartbeat, not the SOC 2 audit date. Don't conflate. (Observed: `Updated 13 minutes ago` ... `Updated 14 minutes ago` across iter-1 calls.)
- **Don't click the `Request access` button or submit the form** — that creates an actual NDA request to Scout's security team. Read-only means: extract resource names + IDs, surface the URL, never POST.
- **`linkedTrustCenters` operation exists but returned empty** for Scout — implies no parent/child trust-center hierarchy. If a future Scout subsidiary appears, check that operation.
- **Vanta `slugId` URL trick**: `/doc?s=<slug>` resolves to a logo/asset CDN object via Vanta's `assets.vanta.com` backend. The Scout logo at `https://trust.scoutos.com/doc?s=yas9uxs8vtjg77rzd140h` is one such URL — it's public-readable. Don't confuse asset slug IDs with resource IDs (asset slugs are alphanumeric-lowercase; resource IDs are 24-char hex).
