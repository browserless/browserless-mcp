# Kmart Australia — Find Product and Add to Cart (Read-Only Pre-Checkout)

## Purpose

Given a natural-language product query (e.g. "drink bottle", "water bottle", "kids backpack") on **kmart.com.au**, find a matching product, navigate to its detail page, capture price/title/SKU/availability, and attempt to drive the read-only pre-checkout flow up to the bag (`/checkout/bag`) page. Return structured JSON describing the resolved product and the realized cart state.

**Read-only — never click "Continue to Checkout", never enter payment details, never submit an order.** This skill stops at the bag/cart review screen by design. Booking an order is a separate skill that would require authenticated Kmart credentials and explicit user consent.

## When to Use

- "find a drink bottle under $20 on kmart.com.au and tell me the price"
- "what does Kmart sell for water bottles in Sydney, in stock for delivery"
- "show me the product page details for the {SKU} on Kmart"
- An agent comparison flow that needs Kmart product price/availability without booking
- Demonstrating the structure of Kmart's pre-checkout flow (search → product detail → bag) without actually purchasing

If the user actually wants to **buy** something, hand off to a human — Kmart's cart-add mutation is Akamai-gated for guest automated sessions (see Gotchas).

## Workflow

The recommended path is the public site driven through `browserless_agent` with a residential proxy. There is no public Kmart API for product search; the private GraphQL endpoint at `https://api.kmart.com.au/gateway/graphql` is reachable for **read** operations (`getProductAvailability`, `getMarketplaceOffers`, `getMyActiveCart`) from a warmed-up browser session, but cart **mutations** are blocked by Akamai for guest automated traffic (see Gotchas).

### 1. Residential-proxy session — one call for the whole flow

Set `proxy: { proxy: "residential" }` as a top-level arg on the `browserless_agent` call, and run the warm-up → search → product → add-attempt sequence (steps 2–6) inside that one call's `commands` array. The session persists across separate calls — it is keyed by the call's `proxy`/`profile` config — but batching the whole sequence into one call is the reliable way to stay in the same warmed session (and keep the Akamai `_abck` cookie it seeds); a later call that drops or changes the `proxy` lands in a different, blank session. A residential proxy is mandatory — a plain call is Akamai-blocked on the **first** product detail page load. Even proxied sessions get flagged within ~5-8 page transitions (see Gotchas).

### 2. Land on the homepage first

```json
{
  "method": "goto",
  "params": {
    "url": "https://www.kmart.com.au/",
    "waitUntil": "load",
    "timeout": 45000
  }
}
```

Do **not** deep-link directly to a product detail URL on a cold session — that triggers Akamai's "no session warmup" heuristic and returns `Access Denied` (Akamai edgesuite.net error page) on the first request. The homepage seeds the Akamai cookie (`_abck`) and JS challenge state.

### 3. Search

```json
{ "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "https://www.kmart.com.au/search/?searchTerm=drink%20bottle", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } }
{ "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 4000 } }
{ "method": "text", "params": { "selector": "body" } }
```

Search results render after a delay. Product detail URLs follow the pattern `/product/{kebab-slug-with-words}-{8-digit-sku}/`. Extract them from the returned text/HTML via regex `\(/product/[a-z0-9-]+/[?][^)]+\)` (or parse in-page with an `evaluate`).

### 4. Navigate to the chosen product detail page

```json
{ "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "https://www.kmart.com.au/product/940ml-bow-dual-function-drink-bottle-43693399/", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } }
{ "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 4000 } }
```

Capture the title (`evaluate` returning `document.title`), and scrape the rendered price/SKU via a `text` on `body`, a `snapshot`, or an `evaluate`. The SKU appears in the page as `SKU : P_43693399` and is also embedded in the URL (last 8-digit number).

### 5. Inspect the "Add to bag" button state

```json
{
  "method": "evaluate",
  "params": {
    "content": "const b=[...document.querySelectorAll('button')].find(x=>/^Add to bag$/i.test(x.textContent.trim())); JSON.stringify({ found: !!b, disabled: b?.disabled, hasGreyClass: b?.className.includes('disabled') })"
  }
}
```

The button is `disabled` for products that are out-of-stock for delivery to the default postcode (Sydney 2000). The button visually renders as light-grey background instead of the active dark-blue. Skip these products and try another from the search results.

### 6. Attempt Add to bag (best-effort — see Gotchas)

`snapshot` first to refresh refs after JS settle, `click` the "Add to bag" ref, then settle:

```json
{ "method": "snapshot" }
{ "method": "click", "params": { "selector": "button:has-text(\"Add to bag\")" } }
{ "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 4000 } }
```

Resolve the exact clickable ref from the `snapshot` (accessible name "Add to bag") if the text selector misses. Then read the bag:

```json
{ "method": "goto", "params": { "url": "https://www.kmart.com.au/checkout/bag", "waitUntil": "load", "timeout": 45000 } }
{ "method": "waitForTimeout", "params": { "time": 5000 } }
{ "method": "screenshot" }
```

**Expect this to fail.** The cart mutation does not fire for automated sessions (see Gotchas). Capture the realized state — either an empty bag (`"No items currently in your bag"`) or an Akamai Access Denied — and report it honestly in the JSON output.

### 7. Stop at the bag page — do not proceed to checkout submission

The "Continue to Checkout" button on `/checkout/bag` takes the user to address, payment, and order confirmation. **This skill is read-only.** Do not click checkout buttons, do not enter payment info, do not submit an order. The terminal screen for this skill is `/checkout/bag` with the bag's current contents visible.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **Akamai bot detection is severe.** kmart.com.au uses Akamai Bot Manager with both the static `_abck` cookie challenge and dynamic beacons (POSTs to obfuscated `/ZchU2Z/w/t/...` paths). Symptoms observed across 2 iterations:
  - First product detail page on a cold session → `Access Denied` reference `#18.xxxxx.edgesuite.net`. Always warm up on `/` first.
  - After ~5-8 successful page transitions, the same session begins returning Access Denied on subsequent product detail pages even though the homepage and search still work.
  - After attempting an "Add to bag" click, `/checkout/bag` immediately returns Access Denied on a fraction of sessions.
- **The "Add to bag" click does NOT trigger an add-to-cart GraphQL mutation for automated browser sessions.** Confirmed across two iterations + full CDP network trace: the only GraphQL operations observed after the click are read queries (`getMyActiveCart`, `getProductAvailability`, `getMarketplaceOffers`, `getRecommendedAvailableProducts`, `getRealTimeRecommendations`, `getPostcodeSuggestions`, `GetTrendingProductRecommendation`). No `addToCart`/`addItemToCart`/`createCart` mutation is dispatched. The button's React onClick handler either runs an Akamai-gated guard or expects a session token the automated browser does not carry. Both a real `click` command and a JS `.click()` (via `evaluate`) produce the same result: button state changes visually but no mutation fires and the bag remains empty.
- **The disabled "Add to bag" state is not just a visual style.** Some products (notably small / low-margin items like the `1L Grey Drink Bottle with Handle (P_43677986)`) ship the button in a permanently `disabled` state for delivery to the default postcode. The button still claims to be a `<button>` element, but clicking it is a no-op even for a human. Confirm `b.disabled === false` via an `evaluate` before clicking — if `true`, pick a different product.
- **GraphQL endpoint is `POST https://api.kmart.com.au/gateway/graphql`.** All page state is hydrated from this endpoint. The schema includes (at least): `getMyActiveCart`, `getProductAvailability(input: {country, postcode, products: [{keycode, quantity, isNationalInventory, isClickAndCollectOnly}]})`, `getMarketplaceOffers(productSkus, postcode, countryCode, price)`, `getPostcodeSuggestions(query, country)`, `getRecommendedAvailableProducts`, `getRealTimeRecommendations`, `GetTrendingProductRecommendation`. Direct CORS-OPTIONS preflight + POST works from the warmed browser context for read queries; **do NOT attempt to call this endpoint with raw `curl`** — it requires a valid Akamai-issued bearer + cookie pair that only a real browser session has.
- **Default postcode is Sydney 2000** and gets baked into the GraphQL `getProductAvailability` call by the page hydration. The header has a "Deliver to Sydney 2000" button that opens a postcode picker, but for a read-only flow you usually don't need to change it. If the user wants availability for a specific postcode, change it via the picker before the product detail load.
- **Product URL pattern is `/product/{kebab-slug}-{8-digit-sku}/`.** SKU also appears on the page as `SKU : P_43693399` (the `P_` prefix is purely a label). The 8-digit number alone is what GraphQL operations use as `keycode` or `productSkus[]`.
- **Search URL is `/search/?searchTerm={url-encoded-query}`.** Returns an HTML page that hydrates products client-side via Constructor.io (see `ac.cnstrc.com` requests). The HTML response _itself_ contains the product cards once hydrated; wait at least 4s after navigation before scraping markdown. The page is **not** SSR'd with products — a synchronous fetch will see only the search-suggestion sidebar (other related searches), not the actual results.
- **No public Kmart product search API exists.** Constructor.io serves the autocomplete + search backend (`ac.cnstrc.com/recommendations/v1/...`) with key `key_GZTqlLr41FS2p7AY` (public, visible in DevTools) — calling it directly will return some result shape but reproducing exact storefront behavior (price, availability, fulfillment) requires the GraphQL gateway which is Akamai-locked.
- **"Continue to Checkout" submission is read-only-forbidden by this skill.** Even if a future agent solves the cart-add mutation, do not proceed past `/checkout/bag` without explicit human approval — Kmart's terms forbid automated purchasing and the read-only-rule of this skill matches that constraint.
- **Don't waste time on these dead ends:**
  - Calling `api.kmart.com.au/gateway/graphql` with `curl` (Akamai + CORS).
  - Trying to deep-link to a product without homepage warmup (Access Denied).
  - Repeatedly retrying Add to bag on the same session after one failure (session gets escalated to Access Denied across the whole domain).
  - Looking for a `?addToCart=SKU` URL param trick — none exists; the cart state lives entirely in the authenticated GraphQL session.

## Expected Output

The skill returns one of the following JSON shapes. Always include the `realized_cart_state` so the caller knows whether the read-only attempt completed.

### Success — product found + page reachable + button enabled (cart-add still likely blocked)

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "query": "drink bottle",
  "product": {
    "title": "940ml Bow Dual Function Drink Bottle",

    "fulfillment_options": ["Delivery", "Click & Collect", "In-Store"]
  },
  "add_to_bag_attempted": true,
  "realized_cart_state": "empty",
  "notes": "Add to bag click registered but no addToCart GraphQL mutation observed; bag remained empty (Akamai bot gate). Read-only flow terminated at /checkout/bag."

  },
  "add_to_bag_attempted": false,
  "realized_cart_state": "n/a — button disabled",
  "notes": "Product page loaded but Add to bag button is in disabled state for postcode 2000. Try a different product or change postcode."
}
```

### Failure — Akamai access denied during the flow

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "query": "drink bottle",

  "notes": "Session was flagged by Akamai bot detection. Retry in a fresh browserless_agent call with proxy: { proxy: \"residential\" } and warm up on / before any product navigation."
}
```

### Failure — no products matched the search query

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "query": "obscure-nonexistent-thing-12345",
  "reason": "no_search_results",
  "search_url": "https://www.kmart.com.au/search/?searchTerm=obscure-nonexistent-thing-12345",
